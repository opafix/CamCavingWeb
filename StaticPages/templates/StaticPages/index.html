  <h1>Cambridge University Caving Club</h1>
  <p>For more than 70 years, the CUCC have been introducing people to the underworld. Some have never visited a cave and most want to experience something wholly new. The challenge and sense of adventure posed by caving are varied. In rough order of difficulty, challenges include: scrambling, free climbing, climbing ladders, moving vertically on ropes using SRT, and overcoming vertical re-belays, deviation and knots.</p>
  <p>Once you feel competent with it (which takes very different periods for each person) the following further challenges await: helping a leader to derig, rigging already bolted pitches, navigating your way using surveys, surveying newly discovered cave by using measuring instruments and computer software, bolting both by hand and with drills, and leading groups.</p>
  <p>The CUCC organises caving trips every other weekend during university term time, so there is plenty of choice for you to try. Longer trips take place during the rest of the year. A one week trip (the so-called "President's Meet") is organised in Easter to somewhere in Europe, usually to Ardeche in France, and an expedition happens every Summer to explore new caves in Austria (<a href="http://expo.survex.com/">http://expo.survex.com</a>). These longer trips take place in great environments, so there is plenty of choice for other outdoor activities as well, such as cycling, hiking, and climbing.</p>
  <p>In addition to physical fitness and vertical progression techniques, caving can help you develop your endurance, focus, team working, decision capacity, planning and organising, pacing yourself, orientation, identifying and minimising risks, etc. And once you get experience moving up, down and through caves, you could seek for a whole new range of activities to keep excitement up: exploration and topography, photography, rescue techniques, bio & geospeleology, speleo-anthropology... so it's not just about getting muddy!</p>
  <p>And CUCC is not just about caving: while in Cambridge there are plenty of activities and socials which are regularly announced on the mailing list and Facebook Page, including pub meets, training sessions, curry nights, talks, other outdoor activities.</p>
  <p>In any case, the website offers a whole range of information including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calendar of when/where caving meets & social events are happening</li>
    <li>Details on caving trips / gear / cost etc.</li>
    <li>As well as lots of photos to get you excited</li>
  </ul>
