<p>Snow greeted us on a snowy cold, misty damp bivy morning. Most of us 
(except Aaron - who kept emphasising how great his sleeping bag was) had
 spent the night shivering away and Nial in his ¬£20 Argos sleeping bag 
was up at 6.30am preparing the stove and everyone slowly emerged. As was
 I, unfortunately discovered (after mustering all the courage in me - 
and counter my instinct - crawling out of my sleeping bag) that I didn't
 have my furry. Great!&nbsp;:( had left it at base camp in the tent 
where I'd used it as a pillow. So Aaron and I spent a cold day taking 
turns rigging the tarps (intermittantly taking turns to rewarm our 
fingers). I was soooo annoyed <u>not</u> to be caving and having to 
spend my time in the cold bivy - am glad to be back at basecamp - am 
glad to be back at basecamp in warm hut after having shower&nbsp;:)

<p>Those who know their expo lore will be aware of the fun and games I 
endured whilst attempting to tow a decrepit trailer accorss Europe in 
1995. Since then I've been pouring money into various European breakdown
 schemes without further incident - so I was about due for a return on 
my investment. Somewhere north of Hamburg I noticed that my bonnet 
seemed to be flapping around quite a lot. Having established that it was
 actually shut, I ignored the problem for 5 hours until it had clearly 
got worse. It turns out that the corrosion on the bit of bonnet that the
 catch was attached to had got so bad that it was in danger of 
completely unattaching itself - in which case the bonnet could spring 
open. At this point, I decided to make use of my breakdown cover. To 
make this a trad. style breakdown I didn't have a mobile with me, so I 
spent a nostalgic 2 hours sitting in a Gasthof - completely unaware of 
what (if anything) was happening reminiscing about similar experience at
 the side of various European motorways all those years ago. Eventually 
the mechanic turned up, laughed at the state of my bonnet, bolted it 
together through the remaining bits of good metal and gaffered it shut. 
Overall I was only delayed by about 2.5 hours, and made it to Austria 
without further incident.

<p>Tramped along the [Shagway?] armed with a GPS location for 115. 
Neither of us had been there before, but I recalled seeing a marking 
showing the way to the cave from the main 204 path. This we duly found 
and wandered off in the direction of the arrow. Spotted a small entrance
 which we (erroneously) took as a sign that we were very close to the 
main entrance. Spent 30 mins thrashing around in bunde and teetering 
down cliffs whilst the distance to the cave remained stuck at around 30m
 according to the GPS. We suspected we were too high, and eventually got
 low enough down that we could see the entrance.
</p><p>Went in for about 5 mins, through a crawl which enlarges to a 
small chamber before a climb down. The radon detector is hung in an 
alcove on the right (on the way in) in this chamber to keep it out of 
the (considerable) draught. Satisfied with our day's work, we headed off
 to the Loserh√ºtte for a jar.

<p>After quite a few trains and 6 days cycling in Italy I ended up in

 Only covering was a sheet, which meant sleeping on the actual bed 
without anything separating you from the carpet-like covering on the 
bed. Very comfortable and cooling ... Got up at 5am to be greeted by the
 guard bearing my breakfast tray (only two Semmel and a cuppa but still -
 service!). Train from Attnang Puchheim to Bad Aussee, where Dour was 
waiting next to a Citroen van which was looking significantly more

<p>For the past 3 days, four friendly Hungarians who got in touch with 
us through Stuart Bennett have visited us. Thery accomplished a tourist 
trip dopwn to Kiwi Suit, and carried enough gear to camp self

<p>We left a bag of stuff stored at the bivi cave, most of it survived 
intact.  A mouse appeared to have had a nibble at the food box but 
failed to get through the gaffer tape, let alone open the lid.  It also 
nibbled the Tunnocks that we accidentally left.  We left a tent and lilo
 in a drybag.  The elastic in the tent poles is no longer very stretchy,

<p>We went looking for a 'back door' into 97. Olly found a promising 
looking shaft (2007-70) which he descended. 2007-70 is located on a 
slight rise on the edge of a stretch of pavement just beyond 97.  The 
entrance is a approximately 1.5m diameter shaft with a horizontal 
connection to an adjacent (larger) shaft a few metres down.  At the 
base, an icy snow slope drops away before the roof comes down - possibly
 passable with less ice/snow. Above this end, and ice fall comes in from
 a small passage up which I couldn't easily get to.  The larger adjacent
 shaft doesn't have any leads.  While walking back Olly noticed a low 
entrance (2007-71) in a slope.  We took it in turns moving rocks out of 
the way, and Olly went in.  It drafts out a fair amount, though not as 
much as Draft Bitter.  I went back to the bivy (twice because I was 
forgettful in my excitement at finding a new cave) to get my caving gear
 and we went underground.
</p><p>After the low wriggly start it improved to 
walking/stooping/crawling passage.  There is a currently undescended 
pitch early on the right, another at the current end, and a yet to be 
explored side passage.  I have high hopes that it will be a significant 
cave in its own right, or else connect with 97 or 76...

<p>Went back to look at 148, 20 years after it was last explored. 
Crawling entrance to a squeeze and climb into a larger passage, so far 
the same as the old description and similar to the old survey if you 
rotate it by about 56 degrees. Then at the junction right doesn't 
actually choke - there is a way on doubling back that ends at a diggable
 sandy crawl.  Left at the previous junction was missing the snow from 
1987 and led to a pitch which you could reach either approximately 10m 
from the bottom of 20m up. Daylight just about comes in from above along
 with lots of drips presumably a snow plug on the surface above a big 
pitch very close to the 204 path.  
</p><p>I got really cold cos it drafted a lot and I was only wearing one
 lot of thermals under my furry. At the base of the pitch left went to 
loose boulders, a low continuation and before that another pitch.  The 
other way didn't go very far, low down, but level with the lower entry 
the pitch continued.  Olly went here till he got to a big 
aven/chamber/pitch type thing, and I sat and got cold cos my arm hurt 
where I scalded it in the morning.  We surveyed half of it on the way 
out and found some old survey notes on the floor - we plan to photo them
 before moving them out of the cave.

<p>Jenny was (uncharacteristically) not feeling well so she sat in what 
little shade there was, while I went underground. First, at Cairn cave I
 put in a tag spit, then used that plus a thread backup and two 
protectors to descend.  The pitch head is awkward, then bells out to 
land on a rubble floor with a dirty snowplug.  A chink of light enters 
upslope from a nearby shaft, while downslope the roof lowers and chokes.
  This is the source of the outward draft noted at the entrance.  
</p><p>Then onto 148- I entered in thermals plus oversuit and drilled 
and set two spits for the pitch which bypasses the squeeze and climb.  
Then surface surveyed from 148 to 2006-70.

 as the bottom of Ariston.  Met James C in Wolpertinger Way, he was 
heading out because he was cold, and caught up with the others at the 
head of Steel Toe Cap.  Mark D rigged the last Ariston pitch, I rigged 
the first Kiwi Suit pitch, then wibbled on the start of the traverse to 
the second for long enough that Mark D took over again - pausing only to
 spit in a pot at the head of the fourth Kiwi Suit pitch, i.e. the Brown
 Trouser Pitch head.  Mission accomplished we headed out.

<p>The previous day's team had rigged to GLAD (God Loves a Drunk). Our 
plan was to continue the rig as near to the pushing front as possible, 
so that a later team could come in and do a quick push.  We also 
intended to install some radon detectors and tidy up various bits of 
rigging. I put in a higher bolt on the last hang in Ariston and was 
preparing to descend Kiwi Seat when Mark's bottom exploded. He elected 
to carry on and caught up with me at the bottom of the first Kiwi Suit 
pitch where I was installing an extra traverse bolt.  Our next job was a
 bolt for a handline on Dave Dives. Mark drilled a hole, at which point 
we found that the Hilti pot was missing. It turned out that I had left 
them at the side of the previous bolts - fortunately they were retrieved
 by a later party - so the second wave could use the drill.  Dumped the 
drill at GLAD, and continued rigging through Tun and Copper. Put in a 
handbolt for a deviation on Yeast which looks to have sorted out the rig
 a treat. At that pitch we called it a day and headed out, meeting the 
second wave at GLAD. Out at 19.30 and bolted down the hill.

<p>Dave introduced us novices to exploration in Rhino Rift.  This began 
by exploring a few QM's, giving dull outcomes. 03-57C became too tight 
after 3 metres, 03-60C looped back into the passage (with a dead hole in
 the roof), and 03-70A connected to Grater. We then ventured into the 
seemingly maze-like Piccadilly Junction and tried 03-66B.  This led on 
in a fairly tight phreatic manner, cutting back under itself and 
twisting into a more rifty character, before coming across a steep 
slope.  This was all surveyed in record time thanks to Dr Phil 
Underwood's wonderful Shetland Attack Pony - a loveable device apart 
from its eyeburning laser. This "Shanks Pony Passage" led to "Shetland 
Incline", at which point Dave grew increasingly excited, rigging in an 
increasingly swift and worrying manner. We found a muddy rift passage to
 the right descending this pitch, complete with footprints! Holes in the
 floor prevented further access, but Dave suspected this to be a link 
with "Uncomformity" ...
</p><p>We then decided to get out, but found ourselves to be racing 
against a 22.00hr call out.  Dave and I cut a deal whereby he carried 
the tackle sack along the passage and I pulled it up the pitches.  The 
204e entrance pitch at 21.50 thus left me a sweaty blob. We got back to 
the Stone Bridge at 21.59 after an 11 hour trip! 
</p><p>Leads uncovered by the trip included C at the bottom of pitch 
descended by Dave and an aven in the roof.  This was at the bottom left,
 looking down the sloping pitch.  At the head of this sloping pitch was a
 B lead similar leads existed on the right and at the bottom.  A C lead 
existed from the muddy footsteps passage.

<p>On the 13th the three of us went pushing the end of Crowning Glory, 
an A grade lead.  As a starry eyed novice, I was expecting a kilometre 
of passage leading either to Tunnockschacht, a new entrance or 
Kaninchenhoehle. Instead, the passage just fizzled out! It rapidly 
became too tight, although we did find an impressive aven on the left, 
which didn't lead anywhere. On the way back, we bolted and descended a 
new pitch.  A 20 metre descent led to a squeeze down into a chamber that
 looked like it needed a handline.  
</p><p>On the 15th Kathryn and I, went back and went back into this 
chamber: turned out to be a 6m pitch with a very dodgy squeeze onto the 
pitch head. The chamber led nowhere but had a hole in the ground. 
Standing in the hole, the floor started to vanish beneath us, revealing a
 deep looking rift which unfortunately looks too tight to descend.

<p>Andreas joined us, all the way from Sweden, hunting meteorites, in 
order to check out our link from the previous day.  A couple of survey 
legs swiftly led to where we had been.  Dave was thus revealed as a 
prophet of some considerable power and cemented the respect of us novice
 cavers.  Rather an easy task compared to the 200m surveying and rigging
 task of the previous day. A and B leads are thought to extend from the 
top of a pitch linking "Uncomformity" to the passage linking "Shetland 
Incline".  
</p><p>We progressed to explore 03-90A.  This involved Dave cutting our 
old (2003) 11mm rope into lots of teeny bits.  We dropped down a very 
satisfyingly shaped (rounded cross section) pitch onto a stony floor.  A
 climb led to a further pitch.  Andreas and I were left here whilst Dave
 and Ollie went back to peer at some other QM's.  As I became bored, I 
climbed up to watch Andreas rig. I observed that one natural in his 
Y-hang was not a solid column of rock, but instead two rocks entirely 
disconnected from anything. Dave had started rigging from it and now 
Andreas was rigging from it. Andreas later admitted feeling considerable
 fear when I wriggled the rock he was rigging off! After a change of 
plan we descended. The end was dull, but Andreas kicked some mud. This 
impromptu dig was hastened by the sound of water "a sump" Andreas 
claimed. In fact a tiny grim loose chamber with a 2cm squared puddle! We
 got out having discovered this "Spitters End".  Less than the previous 
day's 200 metres of survey, but still satisfying.

<p>After an 11 hour and a 9 hour trip, Ollie and I fancied a day off.  
We travelled to Rundereisehoehle with Aaron in order to wire and start 
some data loggers. We had installed thermistors 3 days before, Aaron and
 I not setting a call out and thus prompting a rescue to begin at 
nightfall! The weather was scorching (hence Ollie's radiation burns all 
over) in contrast to last week's snow. We did well, apart from Aaron 
falling and filling his USB cable with dirt, rendering it useless to 
start data loggers.
</p><p>Later in the day Ollie and I went surface prospecting. We found a
 promising hole on the ridge just behind 03-01. We now consider this a 
rediscovery of 2003-02. Our journey onwards was not fruitful, but on our
 return leg, not a couple of hundred metres from the bivi, we came 
across an area riddled with uncharted cave. We tagged 2007-01 and Ollie 
sent me down (I was geared up).  A vertical climb down opened into a 
hollow plate a few metres down.  A boulder floor made the "C" QM in the 
floor dangerous.  An edge exit was too tight.  Many vertical openings 
existed in a similar place.  We tagged one, 2007-02, but did not 
descend.

</p><p>We firstly took a promising lead from Terra Firma. I was 'on 
notes' for the first time and had no clue what was going on.  It 
disapointingly linked quickly to Quiz Rift.
</p><p>We then moved on to peering down a pitch from Quiz Rift.  This 
continued over a ledge to a rocky downward, becoming a muddy upward, as 
is the way with the Underworld.  A sharp rocky crawl led up and back to 
the pitch and a downward squeeze, deemed too tight without capping, 
seemed to lead downward onto a pitch.
</p><p>Miserable squirmings led to the bottom of a pitch which Nial 
climbed up, making me promise to catch him if he fell.  Bastard.  He 
then spied two hard-to-reach 'C' leads up there and a further pitch 
close by.  Two tiny holes linked the bottom of our pitch with this 
further pitch.  I tried digging the lower of these and failed.  Thus 
Nial told Kathryn to squeeze feet first through the tiny upper one, into
 a 2m drop. Bastard. Sure enough, this led nowhere. We labelled this 
'Dangerous Dig and the Gut-Busters'.  A rubbish bit of nasty cave.
</p><p>Sure enough Nial made it worse by then forcing me up an earlier 
lead.  This had a squeeze which involved removing SRT kit and hammering 
off protruberances. The passage grew rifty before becoming too tight.
</p><p>We surveyed a reasonable bit, but I resolve to charge Nial a 
'shit cave tax' for his transgressions. The upward pitches went on for 
ever, Gaffered itself being especially epic with horrid rebelay.  Lower 
pitches mud on rope requires manual manipulation of jamming cams. We 
finally got out for noodles and hot chocolate (mixed with vile spirit 
Unicum - not as tasty as ejaculate) after an exhasting 13hr trip.

<p>The plan was to rig to the underworld in one trip, so with over 300m 
of rope between us (200m of 11mm in Big Bertha - which was a mistake!) 
we set off. The rigging went quite fast and several improvements over 
the old rig were found. However, we had accidentally left all the spits 
and cones on the surface. When we reached Trihang and decided it needed a
 new bolt therefore, we had no option but to turn back. The return trip 
was much easier given we no longer had any rope to carry! The round trip
 was 7.5hrs at an easy pace.

<p>After the previous rigging trip I decided that the Gaffered rig could
 be greatly improved with a few extra bolts. With lots of novices keen 
to learn to bolt and an abundance of hand bolting gear (well, 3 sets) 
this seemed like the perfect opportunity to sort the rig out once and 
for all. Myself and Edvin went ahead to re-rig the Eyehole and Trihang 
leaving the others to practice some bolting and rigging by installing a 
traverse line between Gaffer Tape and Tape Worm. Edvin installed two new
 spits at the top of the Eyehole pitch meaning you no longer have to 
squeeze through the eyehole. This rig is perfect! Why was it not rigged 
like this in the first place!? While Edvin did this, I put in an 
additional spit at the top of Trihang in order to allow it to be rigged 
as a Trihang (how was this done before?). Further improvements to the 
rig include a deviation on Gaffer Tape just below the first re-belay 
(this looks a bit strange, but it stops the rope rubbing when you swing 
across for the second re-belay). A deviation on the Lx pitch also makes 
staying out of the slot above the re-belay easier.
</p><p>Having finished the rigging Edvin and I started pushing leads in 
the Underworld. We started with 04-15B, now called "Shprinkles Pitch." 
This is a ~15m pitch down leading to a sharp rifty passage which is too 
tight. One wall of the pitch is made entirely of mud, which rains down 
on you as you descend - hence the name. We were then joined by Djuke who
 had left the other two bolting and had come to join us. The three of us
 went to look at 03-14B (which looks to be the same lead as 03-15B). 
This is a steeply sloping tube (-50deg) down near the start of Sirens 
traverse. It descended for ~15m before becoming vertical. It has a 
strong draft and looks like a promising lead! However, we were out of 
time and headed back. the whole trip took 12 1/4 hours.
</p><p>Meanwhile at the bottom of Gaffer Tape.....
</p><p><u>Kathryn</u> Sarah and Djuke started to bolt the traverse 
between the bottom of Gaffer Tape and the Tape Worm pitch. The traverse 
had not previously been protected, but a slip there could be very 
serious, so it was decided that a rope was a good idea. None of the the 
three of us had much experience bolting, and so we had many aborted 
attempts. We only had one bolting kit between the three of us, and this 
meant we got quite cold, so Djuke decideded to find Edvin and Nial in 
the Underworld. Sarah and Kathryn eventually placed 4 bolts of varying 
quality and rigged the traverse, by which time it was too late to join 
the others pushing in the Underworld, and so they headed out.

<p>Went back to 148 witha drill and mroe rope. Went to the previous 
pitch and traversed over it to what was 'the pitch' in 1987 nice big 
aven &amp; pitch Olly found a nice rig down and into a little rift -&gt;
 thus avoiding the loose choss at the top. Looked at the Ice Castle 
foute first, this roughtly goes back under the higher shaft past some 
very cool ice formations (big icicles) and very old snow plugs -&gt; one
 section the snow plug essentially filled the entire passage except for a
 small crawl underneath it which I found a bit unnerving. More ice &amp;
 snow, including a snow plug with clear Summer / Winter layering, I saw 
at least 30 layers (and it continued high up as well, so the oldest snow
 was older than me!). This passage ended at an up pitch maybe 15m high. 
Surveyed back along this (noting that the hanging death in the ceiling 
was quite varied -- rocks, snow and ice. Back at the 20ish m pitch we 
took the continuation passage, initially promising -- a huge rift 
heading for 107, but soon turns a corner and chokes (as noted in 1987). I
 climbed up before the choke and over the top and sadly no continuation 
visable. Olly poked under the choke and you could see into the blackness

<p>It was a bit cloudy so decided that surface shaft might be feasible. 
Went to look at an entrance Olly spotted in 2005 roughly above Pancake 
Chips aven. It draughts slightly out and is sloping down on the side of a
 shakehole. Needed to move some rocks out of the way to get in. Sadly it
 didn't go much more than 10m, the draught comes out of a 5-10cm wide 
rift, which appears after a few metres to open up. There is another 
route lower down which checked and didn't draught. Surveyed this and 
surface surveyed this to Ice Curtain cave and on to 99. Went out to look
 for 102 to tie it into the surface survey as the GPS fix is old and 
thought to be suspect. Sadly failed to find it so will have to return.

<p>Thought I'd make myself useful by re-tagging and photoing some 
entrances. First stop was Skinny Festerers, which has now been tagged 
with its kataster number 244. We also photoed the entrance. Would make a
 reasonable shitting grike for those who don't mind a slightly longer 
walk.
</p><p>Further down the backside of the Hinter we GPSed a small hole at 
the foot of a cliff. Body-sized entrance led to a small chamber with a 
too-tight rift and a choked shaft. Not long enough to be a proper cave. 
Possibility that this is something previously noted by Sunks. Yep. GPS 
confirms that we re-found 2002-x09.
</p><p>Getting a bit out of sequence here, forgot to say that we tried 
and failed to find 247, had a hunt where the GPS said it was but no 
luck. Will study the entrance photo and try again.
</p><p>Found and photoed 2003-01, which doesn't seem to have been 
allocated a kataster number yet, not sure why. 248 has now been tagged 
as such and photoed. Wen to Rock'n'Roll Hoehle and photoed the entrance.
 Found a tagged marked 2001-04B, not 239. No knowing that the A and B 
entrances are in the same shakehole we assumed that the nearest large 
hole was 239A. In fact this is probably 2003-X16, Earl and Becka's cave 
7.
</p><p>Went and hid in the shade of the bridge for a bit then walked to 
242 and took pics. Anthony set off in search of a hole near 204D that 
needed re-tagging then changed his mind. On the way down the hill he put
 the correct tag on Artischokenhoehle. All photos (with notes) on

<p>Went to 161d partly to place a radon detector for Mark D and because I
 wanted to see what KH was like. Walked up to the col to get onto the 
161 path, it was really hot and horribly humid. The path was fairly 
clear up to where the Vord path goes up - perhaps this is used as a 
walkers path to the summit? Path was then less defined and many cairns 
had collapsed. I thought (wrongly it turned out) that we were too high 
up the Vord side and we could see a faint path with cairns leading up 
towards the Hinter. Followed this for a bit uphilll to the crest of the 
ridge and then down a bit to 161d. Already running out of water and it 
was so hot. Finally got to VD1 and the path down to 161d. This bit of 
the path wasn't as bad as I had feared but took a while as a lot of the 
carins had collapsed and Olly had only been here once before and me 
never. Finaly got to the entrance after hours.
</p><p>The draught was amazing and nice and refreshing. Followed in to 
Triassic Park. Amazing cave, nice and big and stil a noticeable draught.
 We so need to find something like this in 76, in fact the only thing 76
 does better is the hanging death - the Guillotene isn't even trying. 
</p><p>Walked up to the top of Knossos (noticed a hibernating bat on the
 way) admiring the huge passage. Were able to refill the water bottle at
 a drip which was very nice. Returned leaving the radon detector in TP 
qauite near the Guillotene (about 3m from the conservation tape and 
reflective marker we placed). Had a look at Staud'nwirt Palace and into 
Zombie Slime which no longer has a ladder in situ (as suggested on the 
website). Returned looking at the skull in Golgotha on the way.
</p><p>Surfaced to find it getting dark and a BIG thunderstorm in 
progress. Decided the walk/climb back in the dark and rain would be 
unpleasant and might well result in us being lost on a ledge somewhere. 
Figured it would be best to wait underground till either the storm 
stopped or the sun rose. Found a sheltered alcove in Mothshag and moved 
some rocks to make a "bed", made a mattress from the rope, my rucksack 
and our wellies and both got into a survival bag. Waited couple of hours
 till we got pretty cold and noticed the drips had decreased. It had 
stopped raining and was a clear starry night!
</p><p>Made our way back to the car, managed the scrambles and climbs OK
 without handlines and Ol navigated very well. Got to base camp at about
 6am ....
</p><p>Have at least got our annual long walk in the dark over with 
early in the expo and it was made much better by the amazingly bright 
Princeton Tech headtorch that could spot carins miles away. And us being
 at 161d with our waterproofs at 76 solved the water shortage nicely as 
well.

<p>It all began with one rock, one pitch, a stopwatch and a certain lack
 of imagination on the part of those naming the pitch. It should at this
 point be noted that it actually rattles for longer than 11 seconds. But
 I digress. Armed with 105m of rope, Richard, Sarah and I began the 
arduous task of negotiating Chocolate Salty Balls on the way to the 
11SR, with the minor detour of liberating 33m of rope from 'Taking the 
Piss.' This rope had clearly been affected by its opressor as it was the
 fastest rope I have ever witnessed. Still, I got my own back by using a
 full turn round my breaking krab and twisting the hell out of it.
</p><p>After rigging the short pitch above the 11SR with a deviation 
Superman himself would have difficulty passing thanks to a school of 
rigging that involves ignoring obvious spits and letting the location of
 naturals decide the path the rig will take, we finally met the 
proverbial 11 second rattle.
</p><p>Having carried a full suite of power-bolting equipment with us it
 seemed sensible to put in a Y-hang with the drill. It is often noted 
that problems between the keyboard and chair are the main source of 
computer problems, in this case I suppose the problem existed between 
the muddy floor and the trigger, when we found that the drill was not 
nearly as effective in reverse. I blame my thermodynamics lectures for 
teaching me that reversible systems are most efficient and my education 
at Cambridge for leaving me with no common sense. With a new burst of 
enthusiasm after realising our mistake, and the drill firmly switched to
 forwards we continued to drill. It is indicative of the human ability 
for learning that during the second attempt at a hole we noted more 
quickly that the drill was still in reverse.
</p><p>One and a half holes later the drill decided that all this changing direction was a bit too much and refused to go on.
</p><p>We went all Old Skool on the hole's ass and cracked out the hand 
bolting gear. One perfectly placed spit later, and we continued on our 
journey. I abseiled down a few metres to place a survey station whilst 
Sarah and Richard admired my beautiful spit placement, awe-stricken at 
its poise, dedication and charm. One survey leg for good measure later, 
and it was time to go home. Nothing would prepare us for the following 
day's events. To be continued ...

<p>We continued pushing the lead that Djuke, Edvin and Nial started on 
14th July (03-14/C) armed with a little more rope. the lead is in 
steeply sloping tube - it starts as a scramble down and then quickly 
becomes too steep and a rope is needed. After this steep section, the 
gradient becomes shallower, and it is possible to get off the rope and 
scramble down again. Exploration ended when we reached the end of our 
rope (~50m) and the passage became too steep to be able to climb up. At 
this point we reached where the passage widened and split into multiple 
holes - "like cheese" according to Djuke. The hole was still strongly 
drafting - it was very cold surveying.

<p>The plan was to rig down then push an A-grade lead for a bit on the 
Flat Worm level. So obviously things were never quite going to pan out 
that way. We got down to the Underworld without incident (although 
tacklesakcs are an absolute bastard to carry). Nial started rigging 
Gardener's World and Universally Challenged [sic - University Challenge]
 (who thinks of these names, seriously!) before realising we didn't have
 enough rope of the right length. After a bit of cheeky rebolting and 
jiggling of ropes we managed to get down. A few minutes scrambling 
around through some pretty passage brought us to the next pitch. It 
probably has a stupid name [Chalk and Cheese]. Nial rigged this on some 
11mm rope so slow you could abseil down it without a stop, and you still
 wouldn't need a braking crab. The rope was kind of just about long 
enough. We got to Thin Rift and as far as the previous pushing front 
where a [lack of] handline had prevented the previous explorers getting 
any further. Unfortunately, 5m later we realised we needed either a 
traverse line over the top of the rift along a ledge or another handline
 down to the bottom. So we only rigged to do an extra 2 survey legs, but
 the rift was still going so we were keen to go back. Nial will now put 
the new Gardener's World rigging guide below ....

 it and a wet mud transfers itself all over you. Sharp "popcorn" exists

</p><p>Surveying with the Pony I was becoming rapidly fed up, even given
 some interesting phreatic passage branching off. Eventually we were 
rewarded for our eforts when the shute tipped into the top of a chamber,
 <u>The Happy Hippocampus"</u>. Some bolting warmed me nicely and I soon
 dangled onto a boulder floor set in mud slopes. Other passages led in 
to the chamber ceiling (circa 15m up) and other leads included a boulder
 choke and a steep mud and boulder climb down. The chamber is around 10m
 in diameter. We decided to leave further exploration for when we have 
courage, so beat an exhausting retreat.

<p>We returned to the lead Edvin and Nial started on the 19th (Thin Rift
 off Dead Good Bat chamber in Fat Worm). At the pushing front there was 
the option of a pitch down or rigging a traverse across the rift. We 
opted for the pitch option, hoping it would drop into the bottom of the 
same rift as the traverse rift - unfortunately there was no way on at 
the bottom of the pitch, so we rigged the traverse instead:
</p><p>[rigging diagram - flake then big loop of slack for hand line 
down slope then thread then traverse tied off at end. 20m rope just 
enough]
</p><p>After the traverse the passage continued and there was a side 
passage off to the right (returned to later). The rift continued upwards
 and to the right until it reached a "toilet bowl" shaped 
[undecipherable word - underrig?] where we climbed down and doubled back
 on ourselves to a shallow pool of water. Through the pool to the right 
led to a climb down into a rift (returned to later). At this point Edvin
 and Nial went to survey the side passage mentioned earlier (ended in a 
QM D) while I started to bolt the pitch down the hole that we previously
 traversed across. At the bottom of the pitch (<u>Flush Pitch</u>), to the right through a crawl (<u>Ballcock Bypass</u>), back to the bottom of the chamber with the pool (<u>The Cistern</u>). We then returned to the climb down across the other side of the pool - this dropped into a rift (<u>Now Wash Your Hands</u>)
 which went both ways. First we went left down the rift, which was a 
little awkward and tight - we passed a side pasage at floor level (QM B)
 and exploration ended at a pitch down (QM A). The passage appeared to 
continue across the other side of the pitch (QM A), but a traverse line 
is needed to get across safely. We then explored the rift in the other 
direction (right after the climb down from the Cistern). This also ended
 in a pitch and passed a small, upward-sloping tube on the left (QM A).

with a too-tight rift and choked shaft. Don't think this should be 
assigned a kataster number as it is v. small. The tag is above the 
entrance, a photo showing the location of the tag is on the computer.
</p><p>[sketch, presumbaly of 247]
</p><p>Next I went to Earl and Becka's cave 7 and tagged it as 2003-16. 
Photos on the computer. The freeclimable entrance was very tempting but 
in the end I didn't risk it as I was on my own. Will hopefully get to 
stick my nose down there before going home. 
</p><p>Finally retagged Rock'n'Roll Hoehle (B) with the correct 239B and
 checked that the A entrance was tagged correctly which it be. Photos of
 both entrances on the computer. Yes, this was a very boring logbook 
entry but that's just tough.

<p>The previous trip down Razor Dance had returned with tales of a deep 
pool that they had started traversing around to where they could see 
into a perpendicular rift with running water audible. Could this be the 
bottom? The target for this trip was to continue the traverse into the 
side rift to find out whether the sound of water was a continuation or 
an inlet.
</p><p>Set off down at 10:30 with Dunks in the lead. I was therefore 
surprised (and a little perturbed) to arrive at the pushing front to 
find no sign of him. I soon heard him thrutching through the rift. It 
turns out that he had missed the traverse level below Yeast pitch had 
had thrashed through at stream level to emerge at a ~15-20m pitch with 
no rope on it ‚Äì presumably where the water drops in at Pepper Pot.
</p><p>Before continuing the traverse we opted to try one of the 
self-heating meals provided by Andrew that the Welsh diggers ‚Äúswear by
 not at‚Äù. After following the instructions to the letter and waiting 
the requisite 15 minutes, it was still stone cold, so we scoffed it 
anyway.
</p><p>Duncan then started work on the traverse. Andreas had bolted 
along a ledge on the right-hand wall (opposite the cross-rift). Duncan 
elected to take out his last two bolts and bolt on the left-hand wall 
instead, then he bridged across the (narrower) cross rift. Some time 
later I followed, hating every minute of it (so I took the opportunity 
to spit into a pot).
</p><p>It turns out that the sound of water in the side rift comes from 
an inlet, and that the deep pool is a sump ‚Äì so 204 is now 622m deep. A
 bit disappointing that it didn't go deeper, but at least we've bottomed
 the bastard.
</p><p>The inlet is keyhole passage with ~3m round phreatic part 
elongate along the dip direction, and a trench that is typically 5m 
deep, trending upwards at 25¬∞. We surveyed up this for ~70m before 
running out of time. Our last survey station is by a junction where the 
main route continues for ~40m to a climb which may or may not be 
climbable, and an inlet rift that is passable for some distance. With 
that we headed out with the drill and spare metalwork at a sedate pace 
(set by my), pausing for a food stop at GLAD. Duncan emerged at 04:50, 
and I got out at 06:20.
</p><p>Duncan had a suspicion that the inlet contained water from the 
Midnight in Moscow series. Survex reinforced this suspicion: if you 
project the inlet up at its current angle for ~100m along and ~25m up, 
it will hit the bottom of Rasputin in 161 ‚Äì so hopes are high for a 
connection, which would be a satisfactory 2nd prize after its failure to
 go very deep.

<p>The trip was originally intended to compose of Andreas, <u>James</u> 
and myself, but unfortunately James was feeling a touch ill, and so Mark
 stepped in to take his place. The weather was looking a little 
overcast, but still dry and we made a late-ish start at 11:00am. All 
went smoothly until we reached the top of Copper pitch where we heard an
 ominous rumble/whistling noise in the distance. Although we all heard 
this noise we stayed quiet until we reached the following pitch 
whereupon it became obvious that the water levels were rising. A couple 
of minutes later the water levels had reached impressive heights! After a
 brief discussion we decided to press on into the drier part of the 
rift.
</p><p>Although the lower pitches were a bit damp none of them proved 
too wet so we carried on to do some pushing. At the top of the long 
slippery ramp that Dunks and Dour had explored two days previously we 
took a left turn into a steeply ascending dry passage. We followed this 
up 10-15 short free climbs, via some quite nice formations. Eventually 
we reached a phreatic tunnel which levelled out, and then started to 
head downhill. Sensing that a connection with KH was imminent we ditched
 the instruments and went for a poke around.
</p><p>A low sandy crawl emerged 2m up the wall of what was clearly a 
very large passage. Unfortunately the climb down was a bit on the 
suicidal side so we tried a lower crawl that emerged a bit closer to the
 floor. Although still a little on the loose and necky side we all 
reached the bottom and set up off the large 6m diameter tunnel. 
Downslope a stream could be heard (Midnight in Moscow?) and upslope gave
 us some fine long survey legs until an impressive echo started to 
sound. The source of the echo was a ~40m diameter chamber which was 
greeted with much whooping. Several leads go off from this and after we 
did a few survey legs across it we headed out.
</p><p>Again all went smoothly, we stopped for some food at GLAD, until 
we reached Mystery Wind pitch where it became clear that the cave was 
flooding again, only this time rather more so. It was some relief that 
we reached the bottom of Kiwi Suit which was very cool, windy and wet. 
The amount of water now flowing down RD was at least 10 x that of when 
we had entered. I couldn't help thinking that we had got out just in the
 nick of time. After a long and tedious prussik we all eventually all 
reached the surface at 00:30 -&gt; 01:00. An excellent trip!

<p>I think it's called Tressenstein, will check in the morning with the 
map. But if you're at Base Camp it's the hill you see (on the right) if 
you look down the road (towards Bad Aussee) with the radio mast on top 
(ungrammatical). Anyway, it's a nice walk with amazing views. If you 
walk/cycle to the "Bad Aussee" town sign there are paths on the right, 
you want path no. 19. The sign says 2 hours, it took me 1 1/2 hours 
steady uphill (slowish compared to most) to the top. You can't really 
see base camp or Grundlsee, but you do get utterly fantastic panoramic 
views of Altausee and Loser on one side and Bad Aussee on the other 
side.
</p><p>The path is signed. I took a couple of wrong turns but made it in
 the end. Chickened out of climbing the mast but I bet you'd get a good 
view of Grundlsee from there. If you're festering at base camp and 2 1/2
 - 3 hours to spare walk up this hill!! It's rude not to! Seriously good
 views, well worth the effort.

<p>We returned to the new stuff we'd found to push it some more. We had 
cleverly decided to look at the most miserable lead: a narrow rift 
leading off "Now Wash Your Hands" which needed rigging as a traverse 
across a hole or down the hole. We got to the pushing front without 
incident, adding a handline to the climb down to Now Wash Your Hands 
(how on earth did we ever free climb it?!).
</p><p>I bolted and rigged a traverse across a hole (now know as Don't 
Worry Pee Happy) whilst Nial and Kathryn surveyed a miserable QM which 
went nowhere (actually it carried on - now a QM C - Kathryn). Over the 
traverse we surveyed round in a loop back to the traverse, passing a QM 
which needs rigging but almost certainly links in to the bottom of Don't
 Worry Pee Happy. 
</p><p>Nial rigged Don't Worry Pee Happy, a ~20m pitch. He forgot to 
take rigging gubbins down the pitch with him so when he realised a 
rebelay was needed we slid slings, bolts, etc down the rope. There were 
two ways on at the bottom. The first went down a pit before stopping. 
The second required reigging and went down a further ~10m down to a 
miserable looking duck/wet crawl which looked thoroughly uninspiring. We
 decided not to go through, but Aven tells us that it's only 6-7m away 
from the Subway level so might be worth another look.

<p>Went to MM [Marilyn Munroe] with the aim of surveying and finishing 
everything below the 48m rope so we could de-rig it and rig it in 76. 
Headed down and checked out the 3rd option from the bottom of the pitch 
(noted in 1987 to end at an ice climb). Smallish rift passage apparently
 directly underneath the passage above with a boulder floor/ceiling 
inbetween. Olly climbed up to the 1st squeeze and decided he would need 
to remove his helmet so retreated. I had a look and got through, and 
wriggled up the next climb and attempted the next squeeze which had a 
boulder in the way. I could get all of me through except one leg (could 
get either leg through, but not both). I got very annoyed and eventually
 gave up. I believed I could see where the ice climb was - this year it 
was just wet, but appears to take you back to the passage above (the 
survey confirms this). So getting through the squeeze wouldn't achieve 
much.
</p><p>Survey this and joined together the hanging surveys from the 
previous week (which made me happy) and surveyed out, derigging the 48m 
en route. Paused in the survey to look at the remaining lead (the pitch 
roughly below the aven with daylight). Olly went some way down, 
confirming that the draught does come from here and that it appears to 
continue.
</p><p>Incidentally, the survey suggests that the aven with daylight is 
~5m from the 204 path, so please don't throw rocks down shafts in this

<p>Went into BNW with the drill and rigging gear to start looking at the
 pitch leads close to QM 05- because it had been raining hard for hours 
and it looked to be the driest option - in fact it was very dry, only a 
few slightly drippy bits. Olly traversed across the lip of the Pleasant 
But Pointless pitch, because of all the gear he was carrying it became a
 bolt traverse this year, not a bold traverse that it was in 2005 when I
 first saw the pitch. Olly got through to the pitch having scrambled 
through the rocks (this is called <u>Scrabble</u>) and bolted down the 
first short drop. This was a little drippy but the water disappeared 
through the rocky floor. A ramp comes in from above (?perhaps this 
connects with the boulder choke in Loopy?). This continues into a rift 
with various holes and rock bridge that all connect, gviing it its name,
 <u>Sea Of Holes</u>. Olly rigged an excellent Y-hang to a level with 
solid ledges and started down the next pitch. We ran out of hangers, 
slings and warmth before the pitch ended, so surveyed out. I coped 
better with the traverse on the way out.
</p><p>Sea of Holes has nice, solid rock, isn't too wet, doesn't have 
much choss and draughts fairly strongly (given the size) outwards which 
is very cool. On the way out we noticed the draught had reversed (around
 11pm to midnightish), hopefully this won't affect the radon detecting.

<p>Went back down Plugged Shaft to The Ledge. I went in to the test 
tubes to change the radon detector (incidentally the draught was back to
 normal today). Olly heroically bolted across from the ledge on the 
opposite side of the test tubes looking for my hypothesised continuation
 the other side of Plugged Shaft. Sadly it didn't exist, which was a 
great shame - it was just a big ledge in an alcove with an aven above. 
Olly managed to reverse the climb/traverse removing the gear as he went 
(I was very impressed!).

 hangers on the way. The drill started to go flat having done 17 holes

<p>We had meant to get underground before 9.00am, but unfortunately

 bit hour journey down to the pushing front, slowed down slightly by 
Andrew A's enormous camera case (which was later left in ‚ÄúThe Silk 
Road‚Äù).
</p><p>We commenced the surveying by re-doing a couple of the legs in 
‚ÄúThe Forbidden City‚Äù that had gone pear-shaped on the previous 
visit. We also had had a quick look down some sandy crawls at the base 
of the chamber, but they would all seem to offer only long term digging 
prospects. We surveyed up the large loose passage at the top of the 
chamber for approximately 100m. There is a climb there where care needs 
to be taken not to slip! It appeared as though the passage was going to 
crap out, but a low crawl led to a complex junction. We chose the RH 
passage as it was heading towards KH, but the LH passage looked 
excellent too. A few survey legs with good formations led us to a 
junction with a passage with a very small trickle of water flowing down 
it, where we decided to call it a day. Our highest point is now 118m 
above the sump level. Another uneventful if tiring, journey out had us 
at the surface at 1.00am ish. Lots more question marks!

<p>In preparation for climbing Trisselwant at some point (YIKES) the 
four of us set off on a slightly cloudy and humid July morning. Via an 
absolute fluke we got to the carpark we were aiming for: right 
underneath the Burgstall (874m; take first right after avalanche tunnel)
 just by Purg. So there we were, 4 numpties in sandals ... and then it 
went wrong when we turned left half way up a via ferrata and then tried 
right over an extremely shoddy path which was nicely exposed. Anyway we 
got to a face about 5m wide with a "path" running across the front on 
which you could fit 1 sandal at a time which made belaying really 
fun;-)!
</p><p>Whilst Nial set off on something with Dave L, Stuart climbed up a
 4+ at a corner. well the climbing bit was fine until he took a lead 
fall, his first. Climbers seem to talk things up, but after trying to 
also get up this thing and failing, I too was convinced it must've been 
harder, or at least more shiny than when it was first ascended. Stuart's
 lead fall was interesting for me as well as I flew into some briers and
 Stuart landed in a tree shortly followed by his ankle hitting the 
ground at a dodgy angle which led to consistent "au"'s whilst walking.
</p><p>So after the rubbish section that made us feel weak and feeble 
and getting me more and more lethargc in hot, sticky, lethargic weather 
myself and Stuart eventually toddled back down the dodgy "path" and 
after aimlessly wandering for 1/2 hour or so we found 2 backpacks and 2 
pairs of sandals underneath some staples. Nial and Dave were nowhere in 
sight. It seemed sensible to have lunch and follow the staples up as we 
didn't have the guide book and were sorely hoping they had chosen a 
route we could actually climb rather than the tat we had seen earlier.
</p><p>As they say, up is the only way ... sure was as we soon realised 
we were doing a superb multi-pitch route. Stuart started and soon we 
were in a fairly smooth rhythm of alternating leading and seconding. 
Well, "smooth" except for when we would realise (whilst leading) we were
 on the middle of a slab of rock with no belay opportunities and no 
quick draws left&nbsp;:-(. Loose boulders, wasps nests, falling rocks, 
crossing via ferrataists and 2 very thirsty climbers we got to the top 
where Dave was sitting, grinning, rock boots off having previously done 
mainly indoor climbing. 
</p><p>We were exceptionally happy when it absolutely started rodding it
 down ... not so much because it was raining but more so becuase it was 
raining whilst we were <u>NOT</u> on the climbing route. Nial and Dave 
had the highly intelligent idea of taking their rock boots off whilst 
walking back to the car/bags which was fine until they go to the gravel 
path down past a railway station (!). Crossing the railway tracks we 
didn't have a dry piece of clothing left on our bodies ... indeed the 
Austrian climbers sheltering under an overhang looked most bemused at 
our antics. We decided to spare Tony R's car a bath and pretty much 
stripped off before getting in (Dave L in his underpants, me driving 
with a bra on, shirt off, etc). Despite our repeated offerings Dave L 
rudely refused to let us drive straight to the station in Bad Aussee to 
pick up his girlfriend who was arriving that same night.

<p>Once again we returned to the Convenience Series hoping to find 
further horizontal passage. Kathryn and I were first down and started by
 bolting the short pitch down from "Now Wash Your Hands". When Pete and 
Edvin turned up we sent them to investigate a QM back from the pitch 
head. This turned out to connect into the cave we were about to push and
 how now been named "Shit Chute".
</p><p>Meanwhile Kathryn and I finished descending the pitch and found 
large horizontal passages leading off. All of these ended in large 
pitches which we did not have the rope to descend. One pitch was 
descended entirely on naturals (and a deviation using the donkey's dick 
on the tackle sack). This led to a large passage filled with boulders. 
It rapidly became too steep to descend (and looked horrendous to rig 
anyway).
</p><p>I began to bolt another pitch but decided hand bolting it would 
take too long. Instead we left the new passage (now named "Engaged") and
 returned to "Out Of Order Rift" to look at a small QM "Urinal Cakes". 
After ~30m of tight rift this led into a chamber with lots of vertical 
leads heading off. The chamber, now called "Indecent Exposure", also had
 one horizontal lead which we pushed for 20m until it ended in a small 
chamber.

<p>Olly's guts weren't very happy so we picked an objective that would 
never put us far from an entrance. We decided to survey 81 and 85 and 
check for leads. We started with a quick look into 82 to look at the ice
 stal and train tunnel passage. No ice this year at all and very little 
snow. Train tunnel passage as impressive as ever, we noticed a 
stooping/walking passage on the right which we followed (just a hole in 
the floor and a lower passage) to the entrance of 83 - hurray, a 
connection!
</p><p>Also discovered another hole in the same doline as 85 which had 
another 2 entrances (at least) and appears in the 81 doline. Surveyed 81
 and looked for leads - the only one was a climb up an aven which turned
 out to be an inlet only.
</p><p>Surface surveyed 81 to 81b to 85 tags and went home - will 
complete the other surveying soon. This is an interesting area with a 
phreatic level not far from the surface. If some of it heads under the 
Vord-Hinter ridge (like 82) it should be very cool.

<p>Decided it was time for a final trip in 148 to push the remaining 
lead to a conclusion and derig. So we packed all the rope in the bivi 
into a very full bag and set off.
</p><p>We used a boulder and a spike as backups, then I climbed down the
 rift, used another spike as a backup and stuck in a spit for the hang. 
This got me down to where I'd been already via the alternate tight 
thrutchy route. A rebelay off a thread reached the boulder-strewn 
chamber floor. I followed the rift off the far side, round a corner to 
the left, and it ended, far too tight. Shouted to Jenny that it was 
over, then returning noticed a tight hold down into the rift, partly 
hidden by the nose of a huge slab of fallen rock. A really strong icy 
draught blasted up from it! Jenny sounded a little disappointed that it 
wasn't really over.
</p><p>A y-hang on spits and some awkward squirming reached a nicely 
proportioned pitch. At the base, the floor was mostly clean-washed rock,
 with a gravel bank to one side. The water flowed down a small hole, but
 a climb up regained the rift. Round the corner to the left, the floor 
dropped away. Stones rattle down the initial rift, then freefall for 
perhaps 4 seconds (starting to whistle) then hit something solid, then 
fell for another similar length of time. Hard to judge the total depth, 
but a substantal pitch, and the 44m rope we had left wasn't going to 
reach, so we surveyed out and planned to go back to base for more rope.

<p>Back down Razordance to take another look at the Far East. Uneventful
 journey down. Jon took a look at the tubes at the bottom of the 
Forbidden City. After ¬Ω hour working with a crowbar we decided that it 
was a long-term job to dig through. We also looked downhill at the end 
of the Silk Road. After descending a ~6m drop a shortish passage leads 
to the top of a pitch. This is almost certainly the same pitch which can
 be reached from below ‚ÄúCarry on the Khyber‚Äù by  following the 
water. After that we continued along the phreatic passage above the 
Forbidden City (the ‚ÄùGobi Trail‚Äù) to the first major junction. Left 
here was unsurveyed so we surveyed in, clocking up ~100m of new passage 
to a point where a vadose canyon intersected. Right (up) led to a 6m 
aven, reasonably climbable with some gear. Left led, via a climb down, 
to a continuing rift which heads towards the left zipper/right zipper 
area in Razordance. The phreas clearly continues over the top of the 
vadose canyon but would require some effort to reach it. Finally we 
tidied up a few minor leads. Closing a loop which led back to the Gobi 
Trail at the climb (where we had previously rigged a hand line). Then 
out. A long hard struggle back up Razordance and all of us ran out of 
puff in the Ariston series. Ollie got slightly lost at Wolpertinger Way,
 but it was his first trip in the cave. Given that he has only been 
caving a year this trip was a major step up for him and all the rest of 
us thought he did BLOODY WELL. We can expect HARD BASTARD exploits from 
this chap in the future. Hats off!

<p>Bimbled down Gaffered, all looking very familiar. Before that, had to
 scrounge rope from the pitch into On A Mission and a bag from the top 
of Gosser Streamway as there was all of 1.8m of rope left at Top Camp. 
Rigged from Gardener's World down and then up into the Wares. Andrew 
slung a rope down QM 04-23C and reported it as short passage to ~8m 
pitch (QM B) then we went into Software and continued QM 05-73A. Wookey 
put in a marginal-to-the-point-of-scary rig on small naturals down ~10m 
to a small chamber. He and Julian surveyed a Quaking-esque tube, 
drafting slightly, heading down, leaving it as a tight QM C with sound 
of water. Andrew and I headed left, back parallel to the main Wares 
passage in gradually smaller passage down to a flat-out wriggle but then
 it headed up steeply and into a small chamber. Left here probably 
linked back to near the start of the Wares passage. Right was a steeply 
descending rift, QM B. Unfortunately the strong draft coming out of 
Software that had drawn me back there seems to come from the roof rubes 
above the pitch. Uneventful trundle out, taking out all the rope we'd 
brought in. Oh yes - had Phil's Pony to survey with and its the bee's

<p>Woken up by Andrew to the news that we were going down Razordance. 
Hmm, really? I was prussiking out of 204E at 10pm last night + fancied a
 bit of a mellow, shallow shufty. Still, now or never as the derig 
loomed + Wookey was keen. Then Julian astounded us all by muttering that
 he'd come along. He went off for a dump whilst we consulted Andrew who 
was going to have to shepherd us down there. Why not? says Andrew, so we
 were underground by 10am feeling a bit old, unfit + generally fragile 
for all of this lark. Slowly down the pitches then into the rift. And 
more rift. And more sodding rift, ye gods. Only Andrew had been through 
before (+ then only once) so we got lost a couple of times, particularly
 trying to find the oxbow thing but finally we hit the sump + the 
unfeasible traverse. Don't worry, its easier this direction says Andrew.
 Hmm, reassuring. Quick chocky stop + off up lots of scrambly climbs ‚Äì
 not too bad but it felt a long way from home by now. What's all this 
about? asks Wookey. We have to go up 120m now says Andrew. Bloody hell. 
Wish we'd looked at the survey a bit more carefully before setting off 
‚Äì except that would probably have discouraged us from all this 
nonsense. This is wasting my valuable getting-out energy grumbles 
Julian. Picked up Andrew's camera case + did some 4-flash shots in the 
big chamber then split with Andrew + Julian taking photos and Wookey + I
 continuing Andrew, George + Andreas' Gobi Trail survey ~ SW for 130m 
including plenty of diddly 2m legs in mainly crawly / stoopy tubes with 
sand or pebble floor. A reasonable draft heading in with us. It was all 
quite cosy + friendly and we could easily have notched up a few more 
hours surveying but Wookey decided that enough was enough so we took 
some cheesy group shots + left things at a complex junction wuth 2 QM 
A's and a QM B with sound of water. One to a Razordance-like rift with 
water, the other with a strong draft coming out + heading up steeply. 
Derigged the hand line + I picked up the tacklesack of unrigged rope + 
back to the sump to put on our SRT gear. I failed to palm off the 
tacklesack on anyone + set off to the start of the traverse. I'd heard 
Dunks muttering that cutting the rope for the traverse without leaving a
 tail down to the sump level had been a bit overkeen on scrimping with 
the rope + the muddy slope from the end of the traverse down had been 
awkward on the way there but, hey, nobody had actually fallen off it 
yet. Andrew had mentioned it was easier high but with the tacklesack I 
didn't want to slither a long way down so I gingerly teetered forward on
 muddy ledges + eyed up the slot in the sump, wondering if it was narrow
 enough that I couldn't possibly fall down it. Yes I thought + promptly 
my foot slid + I decided to check it out. 'Shit'. Then I've got one foot
 under the water + the other braced on the far wall with the tacklesack 
dangling like a Mafioso's cement sack from my waist + some serious knee 
shake. ‚ÄúAndrew's coming‚Äù shouts Wookey. He gets his long cows tail 
into the traverse + I manage to clip my cow's tail into his footloops + 
then do a flailing prussik up him and onto the traverse. <u>Still</u> 
nobody volunteered to take the fucking tacklesack. I hauled myself 
across the traverse trying to maintain enough stress that my 8pm spit 
sample on the far side was a good 'un. Right, that was my low point, 
literally as well as figuratively. Andrew derigged the traverse whilst 
collecting his spit + gobs as soon as he gets over. Were you holding the
 spit pot whilst you derigged? asked Wookey. Er, he's good but even 
Andrew probably didn't have a spare hand there. Tootled up the rift ‚Äì 
not as bad as feared, route-finding easier than on the way down + it 
didn't seem any more energetic than on the way down, especially as all 
the pitches are nice + bite sized. I didn't let anyone have a 
cup-of-soup at the camp as we didn't deserve it. On + on, I'd forgotten 
all the pitches by now. I managed to do an awkward section right at the 
bottom whilst everyone else wandered around trying to find the way 
higher up. Then a really long pitch, followed by another largish one. I 
got a bit concerned as Julian would be slow on this + I knew Razordance 
started with an awkward section + a couple of short pitches so we must 
still have quite a long way to go in the rift... Andrew came up swearing
 at his dysfunctional jammer. How many more pitches? I asked. 12. OK 
altogether, but how many to go? Well, we've done 1 or 2. No, but the 
first ones in Razordance are short... ah! You mean I'm not in the rift 
any more??? Great news ‚Äì halfway up Kiwi Suit before I knew it. No 
time out from here. Andrew + I got out + rehydrated, went to bed + 
Julian + Wookey came out a couple of hours later. Julian did an ad hoc 
spit sample just to see what euphoria hormones look like (though how he 
gets his 4am baseline comparison I don't know). A fine trip ‚Äì once in a
 lifetime, literally, for Julian at least... Combined age of 4 team 
members = 152 years, what's the retirement age for this kind of 
nonsense?

<p>Despite getting up at a reasonable time, lots of faffing (mostly by 
Pete) meant we didn't get underground till after midday. There was a 
serious lack of enthusiasm as we crawled through Germknoedel's Revenge. I
 had knackered my knee on the previous day's walk up the hill and the 
trip got off to a slow start as I limped my way down Treeumphant. 
Eventually we arrived at Engaged in the Convenience series and began to 
feel a bit more enthused about the trip. Unfortunately, Pete had taken a
 wrong turn and had dragged the heavy bag of rope down Out of Order rift
 - silly bugger! By the time he arrived I had put in the bolts for a 
Y-hang at the top of the pitch series we were planning to rig. I was 
extremely pleased to find that the power drill we had dragged down there
 worked perfectly. Four rebelays later and I found myself at the bottom 
of a very drippy and cold shafter. It didn't go anywhere, but did have 
two sumps at the bottom. Unfortunately it turned out that me power 
bolting is considerably faster than Pete and Sarah surveying (despite 
the fact that they had a Pony and a disto!) so I had to sit and freeze 
for 1 1/2 hours at the bottom while they caught up. When they finally 
arrived they were hypothermic too and had failed to finish surveying the
 shaft. I set off back up the ropes and left them to finish their survey
 and derig. This took much longer than expected since Pete had forgotten
 his spanner and in an attempt to give him hers, Sarah dropped it down 
the pitch! Pete managed tot derig most of it using a maillon but in the 
end I had to abseil back down to the first rebelay and give him my 
spanner. Having been sat at the top of the pitch for over two hours, 
Sarah and I were once again hypothermic so set off out as soon as Pete 
arrived. 
</p><p>We stopped briefly in Dead Good Bat chamber for soup, but due to 
the passing of time we were starting t come close to our 9am callout so 
we didn't stop for long. At the bottom of Cerberus I left the other two 
(and my tackle sack) in order to get out in time for our callout and 
extend it for the others. I was extremely glad of Wookey's double 
strength Ibuprofen which made prussiking with my dodgy knee bearable. I 
surfaced at 7am and Sarah and Pete emerged at 11am. A ridiculously long 
trip considering the amount of progress we had made.
</p><p>Things that went wrong:
- had to derig Dave and Djuke's rope - which got stuck
- Sarah lost her foot jammer
- Sarah's chest tape broke
- My foot jammer broke
- We all got freezing
- Pete didn't have a spanner and Sarah dropped hers

<p>Left basecamp for an ‚Äúearly start‚Äù at (maybe) 10am. (Duncan + 
Mark had been talking about a R.D. trip the day before...) Got to Stone 
Bridge early afternoon. JonT was itching for a RD derigging trip - 
already up there for a few days, wanted a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù trip. Aaron + I 
pulled on our gear quickly, &amp; then the three of us set off down 
204A... Duncan &amp; Mark to follow after a few hours.
</p><p>My second trip in Austria, first one was with Aaron to do some 
science stuff in a shallow cave. This RD trip turned out to be quite 
vertical. Not much horizontal caving, at least to start with. Stopped 
briefly for my 2pm spit sample. We carried on downwards (later learnt 
that this was the Kiwi series).
</p><p>After a couple of hours we hit Razor Dance. Much more horizontal 
&amp; quite tight. Had a few problems finding the correct level ‚Äì it's
 quite a deep vertical rift in a few/most places. Lots of grunting. 
JonT: ‚Äúflow with the rock, not against it‚Äù.
</p><p>Got to final pitch before sump at bottom. Jon + Aaron already 
down. Just as I was half-way down, Jon shouts for me to start going back
 up. What the fuck? Shouts that it's getting very wet. Bloody hell, he's
 got a point, this little RD stream <u>has</u> got a lot wetter. Better 
had get out. Oops, no chest jammer on central MR (in dangly bag) ‚Äì 
have to go right down. Thunderstorm?
</p><p>Put chest jammer on. Jon volunteers to derig ‚Äì yes please! 
Start heading out, followed by Aaron then Jon. Bottom pitches very wet 
‚Äì get quite soaked. After a while, bump into Duncan &amp; Mark. Good 
to see them. Say they've re-rigged Paster of Muppets pitch 'cause it's a
 bit damp. Follow Duncan up to top of Pepper Pot. Duncan, Mark &amp; I 
wait there for an hour (<u>damn</u> cold!) until Aaron &amp; Jon turn 
up. Given heavy tacklesack full of wet rope, carry on pushing up through
 RD. Duncan goes on ahead.
</p><p>Turns out that it's quite a mission to push a tackle sack through
 tight, vertical rift. Almost leave it a couple of times. Arms tired. 
Actually, there <u>is</u> a technique to it. Push it ahead and wedge it, then follow.
</p><p>Got to basic 'camp' (stove + food) called ‚ÄúGod Loves a Drunk‚Äù
 [GLAD in other write-ups] - passed straight through on way down. Hot 
food, courtesy of Duncan. Richard &amp; George also there! Set off again
 after a bit, following Jon. Hear him now &amp; then at top of pitches.
</p><p>Leave tacklesack at bottom of Kiwi Suit next to Jon's. Start up, 
bloody hard work. See Duncan following at the bottom of pitches. Should 
have brought more chocolate bars. Find my discarded water bottle on way 
up ‚Äì very thirsty, quite welcome! Also a flap-jack cache&nbsp;:)
</p><p>Eventually got to the surface at 2am. ‚ÄúJob's a good 'un‚Äù. Food then sleep. Won't do that again in a hurry. Appears there <u>was</u> a ~7pm thunderstorm.

 (and two) up the first pitch by himself... at which point we were 
committed... to 9 more paella stacks until the last one emerged onto the
 slabs outside of Top Camp. Ollie came along to help when we were on the
 big pitch below Wolpertinger Way, which made life easier (down to only 
one tackle bag each) and on the final pull we had an excellent surface

<p>Neither of us had been before but the magic of GPS and a good set of 
cairns got us to the entrance. Jon then whinged all the way down the 
entrance pitch about rubs. I just thought he was seeing some standard 
CUCC rigging but as I went down it went rub, twang, rub along with a 
hail of loose rocks. On the way out we realized that some of the problem
 were that the snow level was way down on last year ‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôd also 
not been warned about the three rope protectors needed. After that comes
 a small sloping crawl. Should I take the tacklesack? Asks Jon. No, 
it‚Äôs OK if you just roll it ahead says I. Oh no - you OK? Er, do you 
want to go check out this QMC down this little shaft? Fortunately Jon 
could get down &amp; reported it kept going as a QM B ‚Ä¶ and fetched 
the tacklesack. We then looked at 06-19A which looked an excellent lead.
 After some gardening there was no time left to survey so nosed around 
the rest of the passage there and then out. Be a lovely cave if someone 
with a drill rigged the entrance more creatively.

<p>Some of the people at top camp decided that caving was effort. They 
were right. Therefore we decided to look at some hole we had walked past
 on a previous slack day showing newcomers where Tunnocks is.
</p><p>We passed 204 E to find some reasonably deep but snow filled 
holes. Armed with a drill Nial bolted our way down a hole. Our team 
(Nial, Pete and Sarah) was joined by Jon after Pete had descended and 
decided we didn't have enough rope. Aided by Jon what we decided was 
2007.03 was descended to a snow plug and a slot followed by Jon. We 
surveyed down the slot to a choke. It turns out this place was probably 
already explored in 2002. Frank laddered down a hole that had a vital 
connection to where we had been. Sarah and I looked [continued 3 pages 
later: ‚ÄúQuarries continued‚Äù] in another hole that had a bolt already
 in place and found no leads. Sarah + Jon looked at some other places 
further in the Tunnocks direction which one of them will have to write

waterfall appeared near the 85 entrance. Olly had a look at the 
continuation of 85 but thought the climb wasn't freeclimbable due to the
 current snowline position.

<p>It had rained a lot overnight + was still raining so decided the 
pitch in 148 might be unpleasant, so decided on 76 instead. Went to the 
end of the Boiling Tubes where we left 3 leads in 2004. None of the 
leads looked great, but we started with 04-62B, the straight-on lead. 
This was crawling then wiggling to a boulder which was followed shortly 
by a stal blockage ‚Äì unusual for Austria. The stals weren't huge, but 
neither was the passage. I surveyed back while Olly took notes, and 
sadly my promising lead heading straight for 2007-71 was no more. (There
 was a small red spider there).
</p><p>Olly removed some soil from the RH lead 04-63C and discovered 
that the soil continued for quite some way, so we left off that and 
looked at the final crap lead (04-04C). After moving some rocks I 
crawled down, slightly downhill and over rocks. I was really hoping that
 I would be able to turn around at some point as I wasn't looking 
forward to reversing back.
</p><p>Then I noticed the passage was echoing. In my experience so far, 
small crawls tend not to make large echos. This made me excited and 
optimistic that I might be able to turn round. After a few more metres 
the crawl enlarged enough that I could just turn round, yay! Rocks 
dropped down the pitch went for ~2.5s then bounced a bit more. Shame it 
would be a crap place to carry gear.
</p><p>Returned to BUW[BNW?, bivi?] and looked at 04-25C, surveyed down 
to where it got small - is very easy to move rocks though. It looks like
 it connects with Loopy so probably easier to get through from the 
south.
</p><p>Finally looked at 04-26B, scramble in (easily) [something] - the 
A+ pitch ledges into a narrow walking height passage followed this up to
 a T junction, left is low crawling and right a bit larger ‚Äì both are C
 grade leads. The RH one may join 04-41C perhaps. Surveyed this and 
left, removing the radon detectors on route.

<p>Went back to 81 to survey the new stuff. Not a hugely long cave but a
 lot of entrances (which we have put hiltis in for the tags and for 82b 
tag). There are still a couple of leads to look at later as well. What 
we surveyed was mostly walking passage and quite pleasant.

<p>Our hopes of an early start were sabotaged by the realisation that 
the drill battery was (a) flat and (b) broken. Several hours of charging
 and some gaffer later, we got underground around noon.
</p><p>At the pushing front, James + I cowered damply while Andreas 
rigged the pitch with a Y-hang + rebelay 2m further down. This landed in
 an elongated rift chamber, with a fairly narrow but ruler-straight slot
 leading off. Andreas went ahead with the bolting gear while we started 
surveying.
</p><p>The slot widened out somewhat + a scramble up onto a ledge led to
 a keyhole‚Äìtype phreatic tunnel + slot in the floor. Andreas rigged a 
traverse where the slot began to widen + reached a stance overlooking a 
deep, dark pool of water.
</p><p>Andreas attempted to answer the question ‚Äúis this a sump?‚Äù by
 traversing out along the ledge to see round a corner, but ran out of 
battery. So we headed out, leaving the depth certainly over 600m.

<p>We felt like a short trip so went to try &amp; tick off some annoying QMs in the Insignificant area.
</p><p>01-3C is clearly too tight.
</p><p>01-7C went to a short crawl &amp; climb up into a tall passage. 
This went maybe 10m to a big pitch (probably Pleasuredome). Side 
passages high &amp; low on the right led to the same pitch.
</p><p>A window just before the pitch was some more crawls &amp; a steep
 ramp down to a complex loopy junction. On the right is another big drop
 (Pleasuredome again?). On the left various tubes lead off. QM C.
</p><p>New passage is 'Swiss Cheese'.
</p><p>At this point I gave up in disgust realising that my goal of 
making the survey easier to draw was clearly hopeless, and we exited via

<p>The previous night I had been down to 'God Loves A Drunk' with George
 North. On the 3rd I therefore hurt and my caving gear was thoroughly 
soaked through. Given no sun to dry it, a day of top camp festering 
ensued. I erased the memories of prussiking through 2 deg C Razordance 
waterfalls ("the wettest I have ever seen it" - Mark D) by going on a 
mission for Dave L; a quest to BS17.
</p><p>BS17 is about a 1h10 walk away, with no heavy pack in ordinary 
clothes. One travels over the ridge behind the bivvy and over two 
subsequent hills, before coming across a fairly low ridge, perhaps 500m 
long and running E-W. On the far (North) side of the ridge, the 
limestone takes the form of a series of 5m cliffs up the slope.
</p><p>Organhoehle, BS17, is likely to be one of the many holes in these
 cliffs. The GPS point did not correspond to one exactly, but there were
 half a dozen possibilities within 50m. The area around the ridge 
appears very promising for caves. The limestone is not very broken-up 
and there are holes, big &amp; small, everywhere. The side of the ridge 
is particularily nice in that it offers many horizontal entrances.
</p><p>I took my photographs using Ollie S's camera before stumbling back in thick fog, hoping the GPS did not pack-up.

<p>My caving gear still wet &amp; cold, we set off to the 'Wot no 
Butcombe' end of the 'Rhino Rift' area of 204. We rigged pitch 03-79A; a
 phreatic pitch wead [sic] tackled nicely with a single backed-up bolt. 
The fortuitous bolt placement occured purely by chance.
</p><p>03-76B leads out from the opposite side of the pitch head, but 
would require a handful of bolts to access. Aaron took some time 
rigging, at one point succeeding in incorporating his chest tape into 
the rig accidentally. We descended the pitch, now named 'Hollow 
Sausage.' It is phreatic in character, with a shelf around halfway down 
before the shaft balloons out, then contracts again.
</p><p>At the bottom of this 9m pitch, one finds one's body in a small 
widening of a tall, narrow, and windy rift. This had a small stream at 
the bottom and had been named "Dover's Last Stand". The crawl to the 
pitchhead is likewise rocky.
</p><p>A boulder choke prevents one travelling far downhill the rift. 
Uphill there are fine mud formations on the left wall. A 4m climb leads 
to a narrowing of the rift. It gets too tight, but there seems to be a 
route above of B/C QM calibre. This is tough and may qualify as being a 
pitch. Would be better explored downhill.

<p>Ollie, Aaron and I went for a 2.5 hour jaunt down 204e.  The main 
purpose was to place some thermistors in Chocolate Salty Balls for 
Aaron.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Ollie and I looked at some QMs 01-39 C should be downgraded to a D lead.  It seems to be boulder choked.

<p>Needed an easy trip in order to walk down hill for Trisselwand, so 
picked a QM on the survey which was interestingly above the huge aven in
 Hippocratic Oath. QM 06-7A at the end of Goesser Streamway. Also took 
in a rope to replace 1996 traverse line in Cave Tree Chamber (9mm bit of
 2006 red stuff ~15m).
</p><p>Discovered that top of line was tied to 2 large but loose 
boulders. One moved 3 feet with a slight touch! Took opportunity to get 
[?vase] photos of large falling boulder. 2nd [?shot] (boulder) was 
great. Put in 2 bolts to make it safe, using opportunity to teach John B
 how to put in drill bolts.
</p><p>Rigged down - cave is not quite like survey. Actually p3 &amp; p6
 after ~4m and then ~p8 after ~12m then ~30m of streamway to final p29. 
Got to end to find [?bury] bolt on far side of pitch but no back-up 
bolts / threads / anything. Someone had been very necky. Put in 2 bolts 
for traverse to pitch (drills are great) and dropped to bottom. Nice 
winding passage sadly went nowhere solid rock at one end, deepish (0.6m)
 pool and impenetrable rift [?inuing king] stream, at the other end. 
Surveyed (2 legs, ~38m) and derigged and went home with big fat bag of

<p>The previous day, we walked to 2007-04 with Wookey.  On the 8th we 
pushed and surveyed this.  The cave is in a loose depression on the 
ridge behind the bivi.  It has plenty of snow in the entrances and 
dramatic slabs of rock hovering above it.
</p><p>The north entrance leads to 'Slackwell's Stumble', a boulder choked passage with bouldery floor.
</p><p>The other entrance leads to a snowy slide down into ' John's 
Winter Wonderland' or alternatively a precarious 3m climb leading to a 
boring chamber or a bouldery passage into 'Quick wee chamber', with a 
ledge on the opposite side.
</p><p>Quick wee has a high entrance inaccessible to us.  John's winter 
wonderland has a too tight passage that echoes and feels as if it may 
'go' under the snow.
</p><p>2007-04 has been tagged by us as such.
</p><p>We had several 'brown alert' moments on climbs, due to 
slipperiness and looseness.  Another memorable time was when I put in a 
crap spit, then reached to hang a sling from a natural.  The snow under 
me collapsed, dropping me 4m.  Luckily onto more snow.  I slid down the 
snow towards the Winter Wonderland, before the rope became taut and 
caught me.  Worrying.

<p>Given light rucksacks and a nice day decided to investigate doing 161
 from 204 and thus check out the practicality of route. walked to 161 d 
without much faffing decided to have a tourist in cags and headtorches 
and to show John fine passage off triassic park.  Nice trip for about 50
 mins, including some photos.
</p><p>Then continued along traverse to 161 e and f.  Found a large 
entrance sloping in, untagged and unmarked. Assumed it was 161 e but 
later research showed that it was further north than 161 f which we came
 across a few mins later.  The entrance must be known? Later marked bivi
 site cave list to say 161e is not tagged/marked, but seems that is 
confusion not fact.  
</p><p>Continued following traverse which was generally easy to follow. 
 Bit of bunde cutting would make it lovely.  Got out from below cliff 
after 45 mins but then got into complex area of shelves.  Not sure best 
route to take as we had no GPS.  Ridge looks completely different from 
the back side. Very hard to tell which peak is which and a hole load of 
extra peaks appear.  ridge is not really a ridge at all and is about 
500m wide.  Eventually struck due west and came out 300m North of the 
bivi.
</p><p>Found a couple of caves en-route.  1st explored enthusiastically 
by John B despite not being good in Tshirts and shorts (low, crawly).  
Slight draft.  Unfortunately due to no GPS we won't find it again for 
years.
</p><p>Also found large hole 200m from bivi, described in 'slippery hole' entry.
</p><p>With all the aving and sub-optimal walk whole walk from car park 
took about 5 1/2 hrs.  From 161d it is probably about 2hrs to 204 by 
sensible route.  1 1/2 to nearer entrance.  Route needs some serious 
honing to make practical for trips, but we confirmed that cliff traverse
 part is not a problem (in fact its the nicest bit).

 rub points and down to a spit he put in with a 20cm long vertical crack
 above it. This dropped us down to where the Engaged pitch landed and 
from there Martin attempted to outdo Nial by rigging the next pitch on 
even more choss. Got very cold waiting and I was mighty relieved to 
find, after the first spit had gone in, that we'd run out of hangers (we
 accidentally only had brought two in total!) &amp; could go out. Andrew
 took a few photos through the trip and he and I surveyed two shortish 
QM's whilst Nial and Martin headed out. We then derigged the rope in

By 9.30 the fast lane was 6" deep and the slow lane was too deep for 
lorries.  There were cars broken down on the hard shoulder with the 
water up to their windows.
</p><p>I was approx 150 cars back from the point where the police closed the M5.
</p><p>Then the highways agency took over... The rain stopped at 11pm 
but it took the highways agency another six hours to notice.  I was 
released back onto the motorway at 05.30.  Got an hours kip.
</p><p>Then to start packing - bit of a rush considering I was to pick 
up Mr Underwood in Reading.  However, the railways were closed south of 
Birmingham.
</p><p>So at the last possible minute Phil found a train that was going to stansted. 
</p><p>Anyway, it all came together. Packed in 2 hours - drove to 
Stansted - found Phil and George.  Drove to M25-A12 juntion found Pete. 
 Got to Dover hour late - no problem.  Drove to Austria in 12 hours.

<p>Went to surface shaft Frank &amp; I found a few days ago - a phreatic
 tube ending in a big bowl of choss, above quarries uphill of bivvy 
site. [Voed?] ladder &amp; lifeline to survey, only small, loose cave, 
[blasted?]. Boulders, ah well. Named Pink Wafer Biscuit Cave as it was 
really only worth looking at after looking at all the other entrances.

<p>Went to 81 for an easy day to tick off the crap lead near the RH 
route from 81b. To me it looked like a tight, loose &amp; awkward route 
through a boulder choke that obviously didn't go. Only went in cos Olly 
thought it was "interesting". Having moved the loosest rocks out of the 
way I wriggled through and it opened up into a rift. The boulders looked
 less bad from below, so Olly came through as well. Got into a rift with
 various holes in the floor to a lower passage in the same rift. I 
traversed right to the end to where it was easy to climb down. This got 
us down to the top of a lot of ice which formed a floor to the rift 
chamber.
</p><p>Walked carefully around on the ice we saw some cool curved ice 
formations. At the end of the ice there appeared to be a pitch down 
between the ice and rock. We were without gear so steered clear, but 
hypothesized it might drop into the ice castle passage in 148. Surveyed 
out (checking that the outer lead didn't do anything interesting)..

<p>Walked up to Laser 0/5 and had a look for 1987-02. Scrambled up the 
hill for a way and didn't see any horizontal entrances. Got fairly near 
the crest of the ridge, so headed back down by a different route. Olly 
spotted a draughting out shaft which we numbered 2007-7[MISSING], 
GPS[MISSING]. Carried on down and got to a hidden valley with a low 
horizontal entrance with a HUGE out draft. Walked inside and got some 
big passage going straight on and right, both of which led to pitches. 
Reading the old logbook suggests this must be 1987-02 (from the U/G and 
entrance location descriptions).
</p><p>Surface surveyed this to Laser 0/5/
</p><p>Oh, in the morning had a look at another new entrance (that has 
probably been seen before). Collapsed valley entrance with a couple of 
leads, one might go but not without an oversuit &amp; kneepads. Second 
lead is a crawling / stooping phreatic passage for ~10m till it chokes. 
This is 2007-7[MISSING] GPS[MISSING]

<p>Olly looked down the surface shaft near 148 first - down to the snow 
plug then the ledge to where a narrow rift heads down presumably into 
the aven in 148. Didn't push down this yet as we have the other route 
rigged.
</p><p>We were going to push the pitch shaft in 148 but I was feeling 
sick so we went back to 81 to tie up a surveying loose end. Olly 
concocted a plan whereby I sat at the entrance and felt ill, and Olly 
went down the rift shaft and bolted the hypothesized 148 connection. I 
figured he would have a hard time with the rope, drill &amp; survey left
 on his own through the rift &amp; climbs, so I came too &amp; felt ill 
&amp; whinged a lot. Olly bolted down the pitch at the end of the ice 
and sadly it didn't go far. We surveyed it and while I derigged Olly 
looked for other pitches we had missed.
</p><p>Back at the other end a tight grovel through ice led to a small 
rift and a pitch. This dropped into 148! Right where we built a cairn 
which was cool. Surveyed out passing Nial &amp; Andrew photoing ice and 
raisins.

<p>Headed into 148 with way too much gear, but not enough crabs or 
maillons. Got to the [saw?] pitch and the water levels rose considerably
 making it very nasty &amp; wet. Oh well, at least the rigging will be 
good in high water ... Olly rigged a backup &amp; bolt to get down the 
narrow bit then got to a ledge where he rigged a nice Y-hang and went 
down through a tight bit and then opened up lots to a deviation. This 
carried on down to a big blackness with sadly no routes to drop down. It
 was quite [no word here] by this point (especially for the power drill)
 so we came back up - next time we need to rig it further out I guess. 
Came out of the cave surveying a poxy side bit on the way. Came out in 
the dark and clag - reflective markers are ace.

<p>Went to survey &amp; explore 1987-02. Headed to the RH pitch first. 
It had a bolt which, combined with a couple of naturals &amp; fending 
off from the wall, got us down. Pitch lands at a junction, left (as you 
look down the pitch) is BIG phreas with another way in from a little 
vertical oxbow. This goes for a while then gets smaller and lower (but 
still 5m wide). Eventually the gap between the rubble and roof becomes 
too low. Would be diggable but doesn't draught. Back at the base of the 
pitch a daylight aven comes in from straight on. To the right soon 
becomes a rift, climbing high ends up choking, low down gets to a narrow
 meandering rift turning left through which a howling draught blows out.
 We both went a few metres in and noted that it echoes and is a bit 
tight - the most promising a tight rift could be I guess. Again, back at
 the pitch, kind of back underneath, is a phreatic passage that ends in a
 hanging death choke that again draughts. Back at the entrance the other
 way on drops into the same passage as the other one. Daylight comes in 
from another shaft. Very interesting to get big phreas here ~1/2 way 
between 76 and 161 ... worth prospecting in the area next year I think.

<p>Another trip involving ping-ponging to and fro from the North &amp; 
South of Tunnocks. Went North to derig traverse past scree slope &amp; 
commandeer rope. Returned through Sauerkraut, surveyed 06-31A which 
turned out to be an exceptionally smooth p30 duly named the Pantin Sales
 Pitch. Checked out little horizontal passage to left which didn‚Äôt go,
 and then dropped the next pitch, yet unnamed, which surveyed to about 
45m. Exciting to find that we had been standing on a wedged pile of 
boulders suspended above an airy rift. Single hang &amp; backup got us 
to bottom where it choked. Very likely way on (marked QMB) by traversing
 around to right into spacious rift ~15m down the p45. Ollie suffered a 
bout of the keenness so we went back north to meet Becka and Martin who 
were on their way out and survey continuation of Flying High. Didn‚Äôt 
manage very much (~30m) before Aaron had had about enough. Avoiding 
stals / pretties while maintaining our precarious position high in the 
rift while surveying involved a form of Vedic Levitation. Rift got 
smoother &amp; wider ‚Äî looks like next trip will need to drop down to 
(easily walkable) rift floor &amp; climb up again shortly. Blows a gale 
in there though.

<p>Pootled to the Wares &amp; headed off for a QM I'd been hankering 
after checking. QM 04-49A. We'd left it as a steep ramp needing a 
handline in 2004. I rigged a handline up (needs ~25m rope) using 2 
naturals then hand bolted a spit on the left wall then a <u>very fine</u>
 thread on the left wall then tied off on dodgy naturals at the top. 
Surveyed up to find an extensive horizontal level - yippee. Sadly this 
was a derig trip so we surveyed as much as we could, as far as a complex
 chamber with several pitches, and we had to run out leaving lots of 
QMA's. Aaron's light played up then fell apart and he couldn't find his 
spare batteries, "I think I've learnt a lesson about redundancy today" 
says he ... Then slog, slog, slog, up the derig. Martin set off first 
with a tacklesack &amp; then pulled a second sack up Gaffered, I 
derigged &amp; Aaron did a tacklesack shuffle. We ended up getting 3 
tacklesacks all the way out, one at the bottom of E entrance pitch &amp;
 one tied to the bottom of Gaffered pitch so a pretty good job.

<p>Second trip of the day: our reward for finishing the Gaffered derig. 
Hadn‚Äôt much time (set off from camp at 4pm) so we headed for a nearby 
lead ‚Äî the drafting hole halfway along the traverse down Ribs with 
Kn√∂del. This quickly opened into a steeply sloping, sizeable passage 
heading steeply up (Stone Monkey). We surveyed until I was cold and it 
was teatime, leaving QMA‚Äôs and B‚Äôs en route and finding large

<p>Off down to the MP/Flying High junction and surveyed the walking 
passage on the right (after ticking off a QM just before Dubious 
Pleasure). This was fine, roomy walking passage. A large passage 
underneath linked back to the main Maximum Pleasure passage. Our passage
 went in fine style to a large aven with a smallish passage ‚Ä¶ with 
snow ‚Ä¶ and pine cones and leaves ‚Ä¶ I got really excited by the 
potential of an entrance which Martin was perplexed by, since I‚Äôd been
 unimpressed by all the old stal that he‚Äôd been getting excited about.
 We kept surveying past the aven and then it headed up a ramp &amp; 
gradually became smaller and less exciting before we left it at a c2 in a
 drippy aven. I checked the snowy passage at the aven ‚Äî it was small 
&amp; headed up steeply but the snow was rotten with holes in and it 
looked a bit dodgy so we left it. We then went back to the MP/Flying 
High junction &amp; did a QMA near to it, on the left. This headed down 
steeply to a chamber with large lumps of flowstone. It was really drafty
 and we were too cold to face more so we headed out.

<p>A fine, sunny morning so we hung around until all our gear was dry in
 an attempt to have a warmish survey trip in Tunnockschacht. We started 
by doing the left lead just after the traverse in Ribs with Kn√∂del 
[just beyond Caramel Catharsis]. This was extremely drafty &amp; rapidly
 led to a large pitch. We then headed to Maximum Pleasure, taking some 
snaps en route. We surveyed from where Martin and I had left off 
yesterday, in the flowstone chamber. We went past a large pitch &amp; 
down to another, smaller pitch then surveyed a small passage on the left
 and then did a couple of legs up smaller passages to reconnect to the 
flowstone chamber, making us feel virtuous. Martin and Olly turned up 
and we pointed them to the remaining horizontal lead (which turned out 
to stop after only ~30m). I then dragged Julian to the far end of 
Maximum Pleasure to double-check that there were no other good leads to 
the North. Nothing looked very tempting but I persuaded Julian to 
continue the passage on the right where Wookey, Andrew and I had left 
off. This headed up into awkward crawls and ceiling tubles and leads of 
2-3m legs. Unfortunately there was no good reason to stop so we just 
plodded on until, thanks be, it finally, gradually lost the draft &amp; 
fizzled out to too-tight ceiling tubes.

<p>We were feeling a bit tired so put off the 148 trip by another day 
and went to tie up some loose ends in the 81/82 area.  Started with a 
surface survey from 81b to 148 in hope of improving the loop closure, 
also tied in the 82 tag to 85.
</p><p>Surveyed the remaining passage in 81 and checked out all the 
leads - except for anything we missed there are no longer any leads.  
There was nearly yet another entrance but it was blocked with rocks, 
doesn't seem worth opening it up as 81 has more than its store of 
entrances already.
</p><p>Went into 82 to resurvey the upper level and check out the 
'drafting tube'  noted in 1977 - it drafted lots and lots out and whilst
 it is very tight the floor is muddy/sandy and could easily be dug.  It 
is heading for the similarly big phreas in 1987-02 and less than 200m 
away.

<p>Decided to derig 76 so we at least only had one cave left rigged. 
Didn't take the drill in to conserve battery power for 148 so couldn't

<p>Running out of time so could no longer put off the final trip 148 
trip. Only had to carry in the drilling stuff + the survey kit, so got 
to the big pitch quite efficiently. Sorted out gear we had left there 
and Olly sety off down. I sat on the ledge at the Y-hang and shivered as
 I watch Olly getting father away, and every so often there'd be some 
tarzaning around for the rig. I noticed that Olly seemed to be quite 
near the water - today it was essentially just water running / trickling
 down the wall. I hoped it wouldn't rain. 
</p><p>Eventually it was my turn to descend, got down to where Olly was 
at a huge jammed boulder which made a floor for a bit. There the rift 
seemed to go 2 ways - rocks went for a long way down the 
straight-on-left route, but a stronger draft seemed to come from the 
right. This led shortly down to a bouldery floor. The rift continued 
over a jammed rock, a big draught comes from here. Olly went some way 
down - it doesn't trivially join the other route and rocks also fall a 
long way...
</p><p>I was cold and Olly had done a lot of rigging so we decided to 
start the derig. It didn't go too badly (even the tight rift bits) and 
we got all four tackles out before it got too tiring.

<p>I started drawing up surveys at 7am. Around 10 people were starting 
to emerge after last nights deep fat fried glove extravaganza. The 
conversation idly turned to ferry times as Tony et al set off home. 
Dunks decided when on the 19th his ferry went and came back and asked 
the date. "The 17th". "My ferry leaves in 12 hours." "The 19th is when I
 fly to China." Fine-honed expo machine spluttered into action and 
within the hour the wheels were on the trailer, it was filled with rope 
and the tarps strapped on, Martin had been working from his hung-over 
lie in, their gear was packed up, they'd been fed a cooked breakfast, 
sandwiches packed and they were on the road... With a good chance of 
making the ferry. After this firestorm we slumped for a while then 
started cleaning and I sketched until 3am, by which time I only had Pete
 for company who was on a one bender trying to beat Nials beer tally. 
The last bits of plan for maximum pleasure were a bit ropy but I got 
there in the end ready for a 7.30 start to catch our train to Italy.
