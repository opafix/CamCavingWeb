<p>Iceman, Maverick, Goose, Jester and Juicebomb drove Tony's car and 
Natalie's van in convoy across Europe, a highly efficient military style
 operation using walkie-talkies to juggle drivers.
</p><p>2am; We jump start the van. The headlights had been getting dim 
and it wouldn't start at the service station.  Natalie's spare battery 
was flat!
</p><p>6am: We jump start the van. This time after pushing it backwards 
out of a petrol station.  Hmm, why does the speedometer stop working 
when you press the brake pedal?
</p><p>2pm: We jump start the van.  Speedo now oscillates when we 
indicate! Lights and wipers no longer work and its raining!  Luckily, 
car mechanic Djuke spots the alternator cable hanging loose - hooray, 
its fixed!
</p><p>The rest of the journey: roads now filled choc-a-bloc with Dutch caravans.

<p>Things we did right:
</p><p>1) 2004-234-10B pushed through squeezy bit into aven. &nbsp;? 
bottom is too tight, climbed up to top of aven where a QMC goes off to 
one side.  Ahead a passage ends after 10m in a small choked chamber.
</p><p>2) Rigged down to the bottom of kidney pitch.
</p><p>3) Put a rope on the traverse before tacklesack blues.
</p><p>Things we did wrong:
</p><p>1) Rigged off the spit "to be pointed out to novices as an example of how not to place a spit".
</p><p>2) Placed 2 unusable hiltis above a climb that doesn't actually need rigging.
</p><p>3) Had my stop on a rope that wasn't actually attached to any anchors (ask Pete about this).
</p><p>4) Didn't rig the climb above the pitch that "should really be rigged, given there's a 20m pitch below it".

<p>The sun was shining and it was a toasty 5 degrees when I left 
Longyearbyen.    Unfortunately I fell asleep on the plane and missed the
 breakfast that was served. I had a 17 hr wait in Oslo airport before my
 flight to Saltzburg.  Mostly I tried to sleep, but that was quite hard 
since I was sat next to a comedian guy who was explaining  to 3 young 
American girls that he was the manager of Black Sabbath - not sure I 
believed him - but the girls obviously did.   I arrived in Bad Aussee 
station just as it started to rain, and got very wet walking to the 
Gasthof.  Beer and food at Hilde's made it all worthwhile though.

<p>Short trip to rig into High Hopes (cresta run) from 204e entrance.  
Not quite enough rope to reach the C lead in toothless but had a quick 
look at the A lead in High Hopes - looks quite promising. Headed out via

<p>Whilst Kathryn showed Martin around the upper levels of 204, Djuke 
added an extra bolt to the climb/pitch in cresta run and Tony  and I 
began bolting down 05-62A. Both leads end in a wide slanted rift filled 
with lots of loose rocks. To the left, the rift leads into a sandy 
passage which has a strong draft. To the right, a dig through boulders 
led to larger passage.  A stream enters from above almost certainly 
coming down from 05-42?? although no attempt has been made to establish a
 light connection yet.  The stream exits the passage down a slot in the 
floor which appears to lead to a ~40m pitch.  Stepping across the slot 
leads to a large upward sloping mud ramp which ends at a large 40-50m 
pitch which we are hoping to bolt on our next trip.

<p>Ferry 16.20, Sea France - because it was the cheapest! Basically 
Julian was ill on Friday so was pleasantly surprised when he had got 
much better when I picked him up (spare driver is useful).  Got ferry ok

<p>Left base camp around 10am.  Keith drove Natalie's van up toll road. 
 Stopped for coffee in the Bergrestaurant and then headed off into the 
clag.  Low visibility but no rain.  Arrived at empty top camp about 3hrs
 later.  I checked the call out book which had a callout for Nial and 
Edvin - 11pm on 21st [should be 23rd?] August.  Although technically I 
should have called the rescue, common sense prevailed. I checked the 
phone which had a sent message from Natalie to base camp saying everyone
 had walked down.
</p><p>Eventually, Ollie and Natalie showed up having rigged to within 
10m of the bottom of tunnocks entrance due to rope miscalculation.  I 
fumed bout the uncancelled callout and premature text. O and N returned 
to Tunnocks to finish the job.
</p><p>Keith and I got suited up for a 204e trip, and Nial and team 
Cresta showed up as we were on our way out.  Again I ranted about 
callouts, and then the others caught me red handed as I proceeded to 
walk off without leaving one myself. Whoops.
</p><p>The pitch went fine, Keith had no trouble with the rebelay or 
deviations.  He had done vertical caving some 30 years earlier in the 
USA, and I had given him one four-hour tree training session in Sweden 
before leaving for Expo.  I went down first and waited at the ledge by 
the rebelay to watch him closely there, but he required no assistance.
</p><p>Once at the bottom, I nipped to CSB where to my excitement I was 
greeted by the flashing red led of the datalogger, still chugging along 
since over a year earlier.  I downloaded the data, which was 89% of the 
memory capacity.  Headed back to Keith and he was ready to head back up 
so I let him go first.  He told me many times how much he was enjoying 
the prussik and the pitch.

<p>The next day, Keith woke up keen to do more caving and we agreed to 
do E again and this time have a proper tourist trip, maybe heading on to
 D.  On the way into the entrance I caught a glimpse of his central 
maillon and noticed that his stop wasn't on it, and asked him if he had 
it with him.  He said yes, so I figured he was keeping it on his gear 
loop so it wouldn't get in the way on the crawl.  I figured the routine 
of the day before where I waited at the ledge across from the rebelay 
was unnecessary, and Keith went down first.
</p><p>I watched him test his stop, and abseil out of view.  Suddenly I 
heard a sound like a tacklesack sliding a few metres down the rope, and 
shouted "What happened?".  I don't remember his response but it made me 
shout "CLIP IN! CLIP IN!" but then the tacklesack started sliding again,
 for a much longer period with a loud boom at the end.  I believe I made
 some freakish noises at this point which seemed to frighten Keith more 
than the 30m fall he had just sustained. "ARE YOU OK?" I shouted when I 
had regained some sense of mind.  "YES" came the response. "STAY CALM" I
 shouted. "*YOU* STAY CALM," was Keith's insolent reply.  I waited until
 I felt I could do things carefully and then replaced the old style 
twist with a new one (which Nial had asked me to do the day before 
before walking down the hill) largely to prove to myself that I was 
still concentrating sufficiently to act safely, rigged my stop and 
headed down.  I remember passing his stop, which was stll on the rope, 
using a normal knot pass, and noticing that the upper deviation was not 
clipped to the rope when I got to it, but the lower deviation was.
</p><p>Keith was sprawled out in something very close to rescue position
 at the bottom of the pitch, with the rope about 1 metre behind his 
back.  It was an enormous relief to find that he could talk and move all
 appendages. I checked briefly for bleeding, cutting his oversuit in the
 back where he said he felt 'wetness' but could detect no bleeding.  I 
opened his survival bag and draped it over him to keep drips off as well
 as I could.  Leaving him food, water, and the personal first aid kit I 
prussiked out to call base camp.  On the way up, I again passed his stop
 but this time removed it from the rope.  I believe it was about 2m 
above the rebelay, and am unsure whether the stop crab was done up.
</p><p>At the empty bivi (everyone but Keith and me had gone down the 
night before) I called base camp and Tony answered quickly. "Are you 
serious?" he asked.
</p><p>I shoved a carrimat in a tacklesack, grabbed the top camp first 
aid kit, and headed back down E.  I started to investigate whether it 
would be possible to move Keith from the bottom of the pitch and out of 
the drips. He claimed to have no pain but it became clear he could not 
so much as roll a few degrees without extreme difficulty.  It proved a 
challenge to get the carrimat under him for insulation - I had to do it 
piece by piece, hacking bits off and shoving them under, removing rocks 
from below him.  I took another survival bag and attempted to cover his 
entire body with plastic, duct taping the two together.  I kept up 
conversation and asked him to teach me a song he knew.  I placed lit 
candles under the bag to try and provide some warmth. Keeping these lit 
was very difficult as Keith would move and extinguish them either with 
the plastic or his hands/arms. Because I wanted to encourage as much 
movement as possible to keep him warm, I encouraged this but asked him 
to warn me before moving so I could guard the candles. This was of 
little use as he frequently forgot and would extinguish them.
</p><p>I tried to put my balaclava on him (wearing it first for a while 
to warm it up), but like so many things so far this turned out to be 
harder than expected. He insisted it was too small, but the label read 
"one size fits all". I sliced the back open with a knife and managed to 
get it on that way.  I began to keep notes, not very systematically, but
 at least every half hour, although there wasn't much to write because 
very little changed. 
</p><p>After two hours he began to worry about cold and complained of 
shivering.  He was concerned about shivering but I encouraged him to 
welcome it as a way to produce warmth.  I also encouraged him to eat a 
little food and drink a little water, although he was concerned that 
water would cool him down and that it would cost energy to digest half a
 chocolate bar.  After around 2.40, I allowed myself to say that the 
first help would be here shortly.  Every minute after saying that became
 more difficult because of course we were both thinking the unthinkable 
"what if they've been delayed somehow and won't be here for hours."  As 
it turned out, it was only another 10 minutes or so before Nial 
appeared, probably one of the most emotional moments in my life although
 I think I appeared outwardly collected. I prussiked out and Ollie had 
tortolini ready at top camp.  From then on, there was little I could do 
to help the rescue effort other than going through everyone's bags at 
top camp looking for something that could replace the 17mm spanner the 
Austrian cave rescue had forgotten to bring...
</p><p>The rescue was brilliantly executed, and I am forever indebted to everyone who participated.

<p>Walked up to top camp, actually staying dry, then was bribed into 
defecting from Hauchohle to 204, and was taken down E on a quick 2.5 hr 
"sightseeing" trip which seemed to involve Nial looking down every tiny 
miserable lead we passed.  Went up to Chocolate salty balls to look at 2
 B leads (02-38B,01-37B), which we decided to come back to as needed to 
bolt a traverse across a pitch. Then did a round trip down treeumphant 
passage and back via magic roundabout chamber and boulder coaster.
</p><p>Checked lead 00-30C in great oak chamber, and, after climbing 
down loose boulders, found that it wasn't a lead after all, and didn't 
go anywhere. Came back out of E and got back to top camp at 23.30.

<p>Returned to leads 01-38B and 01-37B in Chocolate salty balls to bolt 
the traverse and descend the pitch.  Had soo much fun hand-bolting while
 perched precariously over the small pitch - once across, lead 01-37B 
turned out to be a short crawl to a small chamber, from which a second 
much larger pitch could be reached through a slot in the wall.  Decided 
to leave descending it until the next day, as the pitch head was 
awkward, and we didn't have a drill.
</p><p>Went back to lead 01-38B, and Kathryn descended it to the bottom 
while I finished bolting the traverse.  The pitch was blind, ending in 
rocks and boulders only about 10m down.

<p>Went back to the pitch that we found the day before to bolt and 
descend it - dragged Nial with us, much to his delight when he saw the 
pitch head - the final bolt of the Y hang took two attempts, due to Nial
 seriously underestimating the room needed to swing the hammer to set 
the hilti - a space across which a drill can only just fit results in a 
very amusing woodpecker impression, but no nicely set hilt!!!
</p><p>After I got wedged in the pitch head due to all the dangly bags 
and survey instruments I was carrying (Kathryn had to prussik back up to
 me to take them off me), we descended the pitch, which turned out to be
 a large shaft about 30m deep, which unfortunately ended in boulders, 
with the only possible way on a crawl which very rapidly became too 
tight.
</p><p>Derigged the pitch and traverse line (which turned out to be too 
short on one side) on the way back out, and also bolted up to 00-34C, 
which ends in a chocked narrow rift, and doesn't go anywhere.

<p>Decided, much to the amusement of Tony, to try to drop the pitch 
01-68A in Merry fucking Christmas.  Set off, and were fine, until we 
reached the end of Bonsai crawl.  From then on, the trip descended into 
chaos, as we struggled to find No pain, no gain, due to difficulty 
deciphering the surveys, then proceeded merrily to a large passage 
ending with a pitch which, upon seeing an ice formation, Nial recognised
 as Wolpertinger way - a part of the cave off the edge of the survey we 
were using, and most definitely not where we wanted to be!  After a 
certain amount of confusion, and such plans as "if we go back to no 
pain, no gain, then try again", and "well, if we go past a branch on the
 right and keep following this wall", we eventually managed to find the 
correct bit of passage, at which point we found we had to climb down a 
small hole in the floor for 3m - Nial and Kathryn managed fine, but for 
some inane reason I ended up trying, and failing miserably, to fly down 
it, tweaking my elbow in the process.  Nial, who at that point was half 
way along the very tight tube at the bottom, was told to come back, by a
 slightly panicky Kathryn who was convinced by all the mutterings and 
groans that he was suffocating.  Due to my elbow, we decided no to push 
merry fucking christmas and instead went back to lead 03-1B in Magic 
Roundabout chamber - a journey which took 3 hrs on the way in only took 1
 hr to reverse!  Once there, we surveyed the lead for a short distance 
up a narrow tube which carried on from [what we thought was - later 
found that we had resurveyed a fair bit] the last survey point - will 
have to return to carry on.
</p><p>We then decided to go for a bit of variety and to exit through 
204 D - which seemed a good idea until we reached the innermost up climb
 out of suspended solution [apparently the floor had shifted since 
people were there previously, making it very hard] - Nial rigged a 
handline down off a rather dodgey boulder, which proved to be necessary 
as both me and Kathryn had problems with the climb - I ended up going up
 it backwards, and Kathryn prussiked up the handline.  Nial then rigged 
the entrance climb from the bottom up, and we scrambled out over the 
snow plug into the blazing sun.
</p><p>We then returned to base camp, timing the walk to perfection as it got dark just as we reached the cars.

<p>Trundled to dubious pleasures. Killed 2 QMs at the end. 07-39C: 10m

6m drippy blind aven, water disappears off down small rift.  Followed ~ 
100m. After ~10m, water goes down pitch (~10m QMC), continues as

<p>Added a spit to the first traverse and attempted to rig the second 
but the Makita drill died after 1.5 holes on the first battery and 0.1 
holes on the second battery, so not enough bolting power or rope to 
check out more distant leads so we went to 07-49A.  Did a dodgy rig on 2
 naturals and down a chossy slope.  Pitch on L side and 2m drop (with 2 
spits, handbolted) to a pitch further on and QM? to pitch behind.  
Surveyed and out. No rope left to continue but worth returning to.

<p>Yet another attempt to finalise the rigging - got the second traverse
 rigged on naturals - then off to starfish junction, turned right to the
 pitch opposite the snow tube (QM 07-62A). Got backup spits in then 
Ollie traversed out to put in the pitchhead bolt. "Tinkle" Hmm - I think
 I've dropped something shiny and metallic "Spanner?" "No" "Hangers?" 
"No" "Oh well never mind". More rigging. "tinkle, tinkle" "Bugger, I've 
dropped my sky hook" "Never mind, keep going." Drill ready to go - "Ah, I
 think I know what I just dropped - drill bit!" I decided to go down, 
throwing the rope over the edge with a tacklesack rope protector.  I 
soon found the skyhook and, after a long furtle, the drill bit and sent 
them up to Ollie.  He rigged down to the large ledge I'd got to, ~20m 
down, but we'd run out of rope for the next 30-40m drop so we surveyed 
out and headed home.  En route Ollie put in lots of spits for the long 
(stone-monkey/caramel catharsis) traverse.

<p>Got the final spits into the two traverses and back to 07-62A.  Ollie
 rigged a pretty 5 or 6 spit traverse over to 07-61A whilst I 
hand-bolted spits for the next pitch down 07-62A which is a spectacular 
pitch - huge, curtain-like walls of rock in a massive canyon.  Pete, 
Edvin and Steve turned up just as Ollie finished the traverse.  Surveyed
 across and Ollie had a quick look ahead and whooped that it was the 
biggest chamber he had seen.  It looked more like a series of pitches 
with a dodgey ledge along the left to me but we managed to get across 
and spotted Pete, Edvin and Steve's light from by the start of the 
traverse beyond Ykeykey Beach confirming the connection (maybe could 
close the loop with a disto?).  Tried to survey the mess of aven and 
pitches.  Ollie insisted on freeclimbing down to one section.  He came 
straight back up, "OK, I know I can reverse it now." "Ah, jolly good..."
  After we had exhausted all the leads I was willing to climb to we went
 back down the 07-62A pitch and Ollie tried to rig down the next pitch 
but the rock was crap and his spit cratered and he got fed up so we gave

</p><p>A. Entrance 1) 28m? 2) 28m 3) 80m? (NB needs 2 slings for long Y hang so can clip in).
</p><p>B. First traverse, 15m?  Two spits at start, two spits mid traverse and two spits at end.  All in roof/top R wall.
</p><p>C. Small pitch - spit + 50-50 natural block and sling
</p><p>D. Big traverse above Caramel Catharsis - 70m? Probably better to
 take shorter ropes so can get length correct. Mostly now rigged on 
spits but needs 3 slings.  Starts natural-spit-spit-spit then start of 
traverse proper then&nbsp;?spit+natural(sling) and spit + natural 
(sling) low where stone monkey goes off then spit +&nbsp;?spit? + 2 
slings around natural then 2 spits (last one a clown for pitch).
</p><p>E. Delicious leak - natural then 2 spits then spit over pitch 
down the roomy ledge with 2 spits on ledge then spit at top and spit 2m 
down.  35m rope gets to roomy ledge.  
</p><p>F. Delicious leak traverse - 20m? About 8 spits.

<p>After our last very successful rigging trip, Edvin reread the awesome
 description and we decided to try again.  We rigged the rest of the pie
 series and set off to try and find the bit beyond Monster Munch.  The 
description again had other ideas so we ended up down pie r squared 
passage and ticked off a QM (05-1A) with a couple of bolts into a blind 
pit.  We then went back and found monster munch, put a traverse line 
over it and went to have a look at 06-1A.  The drill battery died 
halfway through the first hole, so we left it and went over to the lead 
off cascade chamber I had looked at the previous trip (04-5B).  We found
 some interesting stuff down there adding some new QMs.  70m of survey 
later we headed out.

<p>Edvin decided it was a good idea to take big bertha down Hauchole 
with 200m of 9mm in her.  It wasn't actually as bad as expected - even 
tacklesack blues was ok.  I tried using the action cam to film the fun 
but all I got was a lot of shaky footage of the wall.
</p><p>I rigged down monster munch without any drama except for messing 
around at the pitchhead.  At the bottom Edvin put in a really shoddy 
spit so I decided to put in another for a Y hang.  Mine was even worse 
but I blame the crap spit driver with no mark for the depth.  I rigged 
the rope anyway because 2 shit spits are fine obviously.  At the bottom 
there was a too tight rift.  06-6C and 06-7A ticked off.  We then had 
great fun hauling 200m of rope back up the pitch (we used ~150m) and 
carrying it out when knackered.  Tacklesack blues was far worse than on 
the way in.  Edvin carried Bertha back up the pitches.
</p><p>Addendum: Edvin stuck in a bolt above 06-1A while I was rigging, 
which we'll have a look at when we go to derig the rest of the cave.

<p>We returned to push the pitch in 7/11 Chamber (01-68A) after our last
 failed attempt to reach the pushing front.  The crawl to the pitch was 
not as bad as we expected (the survey suggested it became narrower after
 the point we got to last time; in fact, it got a bit wider), though it 
was still pretty awkward with tacklesacks.  We made the mistake of being
 organised and packing all of our gear the night before.  When we 
arrived at the pitch, we discovered that the drill bits that Nial had 
carefully packed had been snaffled by team tunnocks, so we couldn't use 
the drill that we had brought.  Fortunately, we had also brought a spit 
driver, so all was not lost.  The first part of the pitch was already 
bolted.  A Y hang at the exit from the crawl leads to a rebelay on the 
far left wall.  The rope rubs pretty badly - a rope protector is needed,
 and ideally it should be re-rigged.  Nial put in two bolts for a 
rebelay under a large boulder on the far side of the chamber.  This 
gives a clear hang down the pitch to the floor. The pitch is called 'no 
bits'. We used 62m of rope, and there wasn't much left.
</p><p>[rigging diagram]
</p><p>At the bottom of the pitch, a rift leads off.  There is a side 
passage to the left which becomes too tight after about 10m.  The rift 
can also be descended using a thread and a single bolt to form a Y hang.
 The pitch is quite tight - you need to wiggle into the widest bit of 
the rift as you descend.  The rift can be followed at various levels, 
but all ways become too tight.  Down, the pitch continues with a Y hang 
at a ledge.  This is followed by 2 deviations from the right wall - one 
from a very very tiny thread that looks like it should break, and the 
second from a bolting hammer wedged into a crack.  The pitch is now 
called 'Hammer and thong'. 
</p><p>[rigging diagram]
</p><p>At the bottom of the pitch, the rift continues steeply down. We 
climbed down, though in future it might be better with a rope (we ran 
out).  We placed one bolt in the floor for a handline, but this really 
needs to be rigged properly by traversing out further along the rift and
 placing bolts for a Y hang.  After a few more climbs down the rift 
continues as a short pitch (QMA).  The rift that starts at the bottom of
 'No bits' and continues down to this QM is now called 'Pussyprance'.  
To the right at the pitch QM is a window into a large phreatic passage 
(~5m wide).  Right down the passage continues for about 25m to two large
 (parallel?) shafts (QM A) There was a lot of water falling down the 
pitches, but could be rigged out of the spray down to the right.  Left 
down the phreatic passage from the window from pussyprance slopes down 
to a very large chamber (20m across?).  A rope is needed to descend (25m
 rope?) QMA.  There is another pitch on the left just before the chamber
 (QMA) (connects to chamber?).  The chamber extends out of sight to the 
left and right.  Just after the entrance to the  phreatic passage from 
pussyprance, on the way to the chamber in the left wall, a passage leads
 off and could be descended downwards (QMB, needs rope) or climbed 
upwards (QMB).

<p>7pm, wanted to go for one last trip on the mountain bike before it 
gets taken back to the shop on mon.  Set off up trail to Grundlsee.  
Aim: go around the lake.  Cycled along road, past village and castle, 
past huge limestone walls with holes in them, to Gossl (village on end 
of lake). Lots of campers there - left over from the Seer concert?  
Carried on around lake, up slopes.  Forestry roads 'closed'. Through 
village   and to the track that links the final section of lake to the 
end of the loop. A sign post: 'Track closed due to rock falls and storm,
 track unwalkable'.  Thanks a lot - now I have to cycle all the way back
 around!  So near, yet so far... In fact the return ride only took 1/2 
hr, the road is lovely and I'd recommend the ride to anyone, even

 bit before getting bigger and bifurcating: left soon chokes (QMC) and 
right passes a window onto a pitch (QMA) with passages opposite (QMBs) 
and then narrows, ending in another pitch (QMA).  From the chamber, 
right is a bit scrotty, ending in a QMC, but it does pass over a hole

<p>The mission was to tick of some easy QMs at the far north of Tunnocks
 left by Becka and co from 2007. We surveyed into 07-70A up an easy 
passage, across a slippery hole (08-?A) and out of 07-68A.  Which was a 
relief because I didn't want to cross that hole again.  Lucky to find a 
survey point to link into.  After some deliberation we surveyed into the
 rifty 07-69A thrutching about 4m above the bottom of the canyon until a
 widening and a free that was bottom to top chocked with boulders.  
Finally we headed to 07-82B, with Becka as usual screaming if we went so
 much as half a leg beyond the survey front to optimise the position of 
the next station, and therefore scooped - in spite of the fact that Andy
 A and Wookey had had a pass on doing such on her 2007 trip as evidenced
 by muddy footprints and notice of a lake on the 2007 survey several 
corners beyond the nearest survey station.  Steve crossed the lake, 
which he thought contained dissolves insects, and I thought was bat poo,
 got his hands wet and was able to confirm that the unexplored crawl 
next to it that we daren't stick our heads into bypassed it.  Several 
corners and tight bits led to a rift (also noted on the 2007 survey) 
where we left 3 crappy grade C leads, setting the score at 4 killed and 4
 made.  Passed the stone monkey team emerging from random holes on the 
main route on the way out.
</p><p>[Becka continues]
</p><p>On a mission to tick off the QMs off Hedonism Highway.  First two
 QMAs connected together but left a QMB smallish pitch half way along.  
Next (uppermost) QMA up tight, thin rift and ended in a boulder choke.  
This is the same rift that continues right under Hedonism Highway.  Then
 up to corner to do drafting crawl.  Only Steve crawled through the pool
 as we found a bypass.  Onwards up to a chamber/rift with a QMB climb 
(needs protection?) which is very close to Flying High.  Then back to 
junction at pool and downslope.  Quickly to a c3 down which Steve went 
down to a small chamber with two QMs off both up short climbs.  Cold by 
now so tramped on out.

<p>Much confusion about who to go with and when was best, as well as a 
lot of pressure on Becka to experience a rare instance of Julian being 
keen on a caving trip.  As one of the original 1996 explorers of that 
part of the cave (purile humour) some bits might jog her memory.  The 
log book suggested that we would encounter a pitch in Dead bat chamber, 
and we would have to retreat to 161C, go over the surface to 161d to rig
 it from the high side.  As it turned out, the hardest part was the walk
 down to h with big packs (Becka very cross at Julian's lack of a good 
route) and the cave passage to 161d.  The nearly freeclimbable bounce 
rift (with lots of loose rock) had a rope on it.  We put the 9mm we 
carried, but the 1994 11mm line looked better than it.  From there to 
Triassic was easy walking,k with a clamber up (lined) in Dead bat 
chamber up a cascade of bat bones and 2 further fixed line traverses.  
Triassic was so large it had its own weather system.  We visited the 
pitch to Knossos, and climbed out and sat on the hillside of 161d 
watching the rain clouds gather.  We walked part-way back from 161h in 
the drizzle in caving gear, then changed when the sun came out. It's a 
difficult route to optimise. Should this be considered as a way from the
 Stone Bridge to 161 far north connection to Razor Dance, thus saving 
the stone bridge from being a liability, the timings are:
</p>
<ul><li> Walk Steinbrucken top camp to 161h = 65 minutes (with big rucksack of caving gear and tackle). </li>
<li> 161h to junction of triassic = 55 munutes with tacklesacks. </li>
<li> This junction to Knossos = 10 min Knossos to 161d = 30 mins.</li></ul>
<p><br>
Rigging: Bounce rift - 29m rope for p4 down then p4 up - on naturals, 
needs spits. Rope traverse - 21m rope, protects bold step out of Dead 
bat chamber.  Rope traverse - 10m rope, on naturals over hole in floor. 
Rope traverse - 10m rope, off single hanger and naturals - needs spit 
backups (and if so, a longer rope).  All currently rigged on 1994 rope.

<p>Rain and misery at the Stone bridge.  Beck and Steve left early to do
 [space left], while Frank faffed and Julian enjoyed the hours of no 
being in the cave while at the same time looking forward to trying out 
his inspiration of pouring boiling water into his wetsocks. The first 
lot was poured out after a long soak and the fear that too many nasty 
bugs would have been breeding.  Frank asked if I was using custard.  The
 second filling scalded my toes.  As Frank considered completing the 
whole cave in nice dry woolley socks, I realised I had made a mistake 
and had soggy wet feet for the whole trip.  Frank rigged 2 pitches until
 scared off while I froze and took an action picture of the wrong drill.
  I looked into Andy As horrid lead at the north end.  We derigged.  I 
strolled down from starfish junction to [space left] where Becka and 
Steve had dropped a pitch (blind) and now had rigged a free-hanging 
traverse across to a second pitch.  I crossed, stupidly, and found rope 
on next pitch heading down at 45 degrees (it was pulled tight to get 
down next pitch) and shouted.  Not much conversation with echoes.  Frank
 arrived. I told him to go away as I crossed the 9mm rope traverse to 
prevent him from lighting the space below me.  Technique was to have 
short cows tail from one bolt to next due to lack of faith in skinny 
rope.  Took some funky pictures of self on ice shelf.  Returned in the 
dark.  Becka and Steve arrived within 10 mins of their callout.

 slowly on.  Serena dropped the surveys down the ribs with knoedel hole 
bacause she didn't have pockets [Serena's writing - True story: pockets 
on kingsdale oversuits are unaccessible]. We found Frank at Y-kinki 
beach junction, very cold from waiting for an hour.  Went down the new 
pitch in the rift ('round the corner from big scary pitch') while 
surveying it. Found big chamber at the bottom ('Maya's veil'). Frank 
bolted the way on and climbed up to the right above the next pitch (in 
small rift on left of chamber) to find boreholes (QMA) that look like 
they go to big scary. The next pitch needs about 50m of rope to get down
 it. The climb up to borehole needs about 10m.  To get to maya's veil 
you need 30m of rope and 3 hangers.  Natalie photographed Maya's veil 
chamber, with Serena and Frank as models.  There is a horrible boulder 
choke beneath the veil with a possible passage (QMC). The whole chamber

</p><p>After surveying the top of the next pitch and the first lef od 
the climb up, we were cold so we went out.  Frank went ahead; Serena and
 Natalie followed slowly behind, taking their time.  We came out at 
sundown (8.30pm?)

<p>On a previous trip with frank and Serena (30/7/08) we had noticed 
that QM 06-17C, a sharply sloping up tube, looked promising.  We 
returned to that QM and pushed it up the slope and into a small maze of 
loose boudery passage.  the walls are shattered, so it is likely close 
to the surface.  At the top of the tube network a snow slope leads up to
 an icy rift.  Martin J was able to see the main entrance pitch but the 
ice was too thick to reach it.  With more persistance this could be 
pushed through to close the loop.
</p><p>At the bottom of the snow slope another tube leads into Stone 
monkey, popping out at a missed QM. We assumed this was virgin passage 
because it did not appear to match our survey, so we pushed up to a 
climb up then down.  Djuke lead the climb down (originally marked as a 
pitch) and we reached very pretty sandy/muddy crawling passage.  
Exploration ended at a true ~10m pitch.  As we surveyed out I happened 
to notice some nail varnish just beyond the 'dodgy' climb so there was 
luckily no overlap of survey thanks to the good marking of stations on 
the survey (once we had worked out where we were). Conclusions: ponies 
are good, distos are rubbish.

<p>Excited by the upward trajectory of Flying High, we set out to extend
 it in hope of a new entrance.  Walking out we ran into Olly M who was 
feeling ill and gave us his instruments which we took to his team in 
Stone Monkey - a longer detour than we expected.  We brought rope and a 
drill but in fact discovered everything was free-climbable.
</p><p>Pushed it a ways on - appeared to die but after squeeze through 
choke regained initial riftiness.  Some promising QMs if climb down.  
One appears to intersect phreatic ways on left of passage if heading 
into rift.  Left it with QMA climb up and QMA off to right at end which 
looks to be pitch.  
</p><p>T/U 8hrs

<p>A quick trip down 204d to show Eeva the upper levels of 
steinbruckenhohle.  Started out by bolting suspended solution and left a
 permanent rig on it.  given how hard the climb up is now (the floor has
 moved) this is needed to keep 204d as a viable free-climbable entrance.
  Only required 3 bolts.
</p><p>Then went to magic roundabout chamber, threw some rocks down 
Gaffered, 204e, helter skelter/boulder coaster and then back out of s 
via Cresta run to derig it. Nice trip!
</p><p>T/U 5hrs

<p>Went in 204d and through to Sand pit to look at 03-33B. On the way we
 stuck our noses down 03-32C and decided that is should definitely be an
 A lead!  Hand bolted our way down a 15m pitch at 03-33B, but it rapidly
 became too tight, so we headed out of 204e, taking a quick tour of Sand
 pit on the way out.

<p>Having seen how promising 03-32C looked the previous day (and with 
Julian doing a carry down the hill for me - thanks!) we returned to Sand
 pit with a power drill and 62m of rope.  A series of sloping pitches 
lead to a more vertical section of about 25m.  beyond this, the pitches 
continued with a seconds rattle - this looks like and excellent lead!  
Unfortunately we had run out of rope so we headed back out, meeting up 
with Aaron and Serena on the way who offered to carry out the drill and 
rope - excellent!
</p><p>This lead is definitely worth another look.  A better rig is 
probably needed as it looks like it might take water in the wet, but the
 existing bolts should at least provide a good start!

<p>Sent Ollie off with a bag of 62m rope and the makita drill but the 
rain from the past day was still pouring down and when he emerged two 
hours later he was soaked... and had run out of rope.  Actually there 
was a second rope already down there he could have used but retreat 
seemed a more sensible plan.

<p>Two trips rolled into one! We wanted to let Thin red line get as dry 
as possible before heading down so I persuaded Ollie to take a look at 
Naughty Naughty.  The initial squirm probably didn't impress him and 
then surveying in the howling cold draft led us to a near jack but it 
gradually got larger, still heading down at a steady 30 degrees.  After a
 few long legs we really thought it was going to break into something...
 but no, we finally killed it in a small sumpy chamber - deepest point 
of Tunnocks in 2008!  then we slogged back up out, warming up to 
bearable and I sat on the same sodding ledge for the third trip in a row
 waiting for thin red line to be rigged... but this time Ollie cracked 
it and hit the floor, -123m down.  We got it surveyed and derigged and 
dragged ourselves out of the cave

<p>Derigged the rope from Patin sale pitch and then derigged Frank's 
pitch rope.  Still some time to spare so we hummed and ha-ed at the head
 of the poxy 6m pitch along the crawl to the left from Caramel 
Catharsis.  Two dodgy naturals then Ollie put in a handbolt to land on a
 false floor in boulders with a pitch running under the passage we'd 
entered along and another pitch beyond a giant vertical boulder.  Short 
survey then hauled rope out.  At the next to last rebelay (of the 9...) 
on the entrance I noticed the huge boulder you stood on rocked so Ollie 
came up and kicked it down.

<p>Took tablet PC and second datalogger down 204e.  Serena got 
sponsorship snaps while I downloaded and relaunched datalogger A in 
Chocolate Salty Balls which had a full year of temperature data for 3 
thermistors (one shagged).  Put a second datalogger in crowning glory 
passage, logging 2 thermistors.  Then went to try and find Nial and Eeva
 in Sand Pit.  Couldn't remember exactly which QM they were in, so went 
past them and explored all of Sand pit.  Gave up and found them on the 
way back.  Took drill and rope and went to push 03-39C.  It was a small 
rift which dropped in steps just long enough to need a rope.  Still 
going as a [space] lead when we decided to turn around.  New section 
called 'I nood noodles' because that better than 'I need needle', the 
actual verbal slip.
