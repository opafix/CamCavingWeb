                             Callout Guidelines

   1) A callout should consist of at least:

    • time at which you desire help to come looking for you  (including  the
      possibility of a cave rescue service being called)

    • Number of people in the party

    • A brief description of your planned trip (minimum  of  cave  +location
      within cave in longer systems)

    • Registration numbers of your car(s) where applicable, along  with  any
      other useful information.

   2) A callout time is a request for help at  that  time  –  so  choose  it
      wisely.   YOUR  CAVING  PARTY  is  responsible  for  this  help  being
      summoned, which may include cave rescue. Respect that  cavers  on  the
      surface have to be free to manage the search/rescue as they see fit.

   3) No callouts should be set between midnight and  7am,  as  expecting  a
      rescue at this time would be unrealistic. Any  callouts  set  in  this
      period will default to 7am the following day.

   4) The callout is your safety net – by  setting  a  callout  you  get  to
      choose when you would like help to begin  searching.   Choose  a  time
      carefully based on your expectations for the  trip,  and  then  manage
      your time to return within  good  time.  Remember  that  missing  your
      callout time will waste a considerable number of  man/woman/dog  hours
      that could be put to better use, and is unacceptable.

   5) Cavers on the surface should respect that the underground party picked
      a time at which they asked for help to be summoned. After the call out
      elapses you have a duty of care to your  fellow  cavers  to  effect  a
      rescue, but situations vary hugely and so you are free to  choose  how
      to proceed (including calling the cave rescue).

   6) Official CUCC trip need to have callouts.
