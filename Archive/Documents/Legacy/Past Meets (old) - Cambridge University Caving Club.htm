</p><p><b>Friday</b> We joined UBSS for their annual Bonfire Night meet.
 It took us all bloody ages to get there due to huge hold-ups on the M4,
 but some of us got to the Hunter's in time for dinner, then we managed 
to drink some homebrew before getting an "early night" at 3am. 
</p><p><b>Saturday</b> Elaine and Thom joined Andrew and Sion from UBSS 
for a longer trip to Eastwater (Southbank round trip). All nations of 
the UK were represented on this team. Novices Alasdair, John and Radost 
were accompanied by David and Sophie to Swildon's for a trip through 
Sump 1. They had to be dissuaded from doing the Short Round - got to 
stick to your call out! Michael joined some UBSS members to hit up 
Goatchurch and spent the rest of the day tending the lamb and bonfire. 
Wookey and Tess turned up later in the day in time for lamb and 
fireworks, then a range of caving games ensued: Ladder Traversing, 
Suspended Sock Wrestling, Potato &amp; Chair, and Apples On Strings.
</p><p><b>Sunday</b> One party went to GB, while those less able to walk
 following Saturday's exploits/not in possession of a dry 
undersuit/generally not feeling keen went to Cheddar for a walk, cream 
tea, and hot mulled cider.

<p><b>Cavers</b>: Elaine, Roshni
</p><p><b>Friday</b> We drove down to the Mendips already wearing our 
fancy dress costumes, which got us some interesting looks when we 
stopped at a service station. Lots of partying ensued; bed at 5.30am
</p><p><b>Saturday</b> We both did the photography training course - an 
indoor session which allowed us to work through our hangovers, then 
underground practical in GB. It was fun and we saw lots of bats. Did a 
speed run down Sidcot to get a photo of the ducks for the treasure hunt 
then back to Fernhill Farm where Elaine gave a talk about the CUCC expo.
 Other talks included caving singing lessons and rum bingo. Despite 
reduced numbers we enthusiastically participated in the competitions - 
beer pong went pretty well for a couple of rounds but eventually we were
 defeated by Kent. Although we are both smallish we had no hope at the 
squeeze competition as there was a person from Cardiff who didn't look a
 day over 12 who eventually won.
</p><p><b>Sunday</b> At the AGM it was revealed that despite having the 
smallest contingent in attendance, we'd won the treasure hunt. TAKE THAT
 ABER AND CARDIFF! Elaine teamed up with someone from UBSS to try some 
"route finding" in Lionel's, and invented the excellent game of 
Underpants Fishing. Roshni did her report that was due in on Monday, 
then we all reconvened in the Hunters for dinner. Mmm.

<p><b>Cavers</b>: Wookey, David Walker, Agnieszka Piatkowska, Sam 
Wenham, Felix Stahlberg, Miguel Garcia-Ortegon, Sally Pearson, Paul 
Aste, Charlie Farmer, Micheal Sargent. Jess Stirrups, Alex Crow
</p><p><b>Saturday</b>: We all got ready early on Sat and went into The 
Devil's Arse, splitting into two teams. Wookey's team (Felix, Sally, 
Paul, Micheal) went on a strenuous side-trip to Moss Chamber, with quite
 a lot of crawling, squeezing, tricky climbs and posting oneself through
 the genuinely-awkward eyehole, which isn't really 'novice caving', so 
well done all for getting yourselves in _and_ out&nbsp;:-) Back in the 
main passage Sally gave herself a fright by slipping off into a canyon, 
but did a good job of landing so as not to do any serious harm. Wookey 
somehow bruised his arse so he couldn't sit down for the rest of the 
afternoon. The other team (David, Charlie, Agnieszka, Sam, Miguel) 
visited all the main sumps (terminal, ink, lake and far) and the 
waterfall flopjacks.
</p><p>Far sump was bubbling in a most unusual fashion as the air was 
being forced out by rising water. The stream was rising noticeably 
during the trip so we ran away before we got flooded in, giving a long 
afternoon+evening to eat, sleep, cook, dry gear, drink, talk bollocks 
and play silly games. The inaugural squeeze-machine match produced some 
surprising results (Sam skinnier than Agnieszka, Sally's head wider than
 Wookey, Charlie much thinner than seems reasonable for his height, and 
Jess beat Alex in a repeat grudge match, possibly by the secret weapon 
of shiny pants). We'll have to see who got the best injury, but I reckon
 it might be Felix&nbsp;:-) 
Charlie and Miguel were unbeatable at the 
'how-far-away-can-you-put-a-can-whilst-one-person-touches-the-chair' 
game. And there was also broom game, upside-down ladder climbing, 
table-traversing, pole-climbing and pan-and-sling. Standards are high 
already...
</p><p>T/U: 4hrs. 
</p><p><b>Sunday</b>: Heavy rain was threatened, which would make the 
usual caves unpleasantly wet so Jess+Alex's picked us something more 
suitable. After a certain amount of faffage (whilst Paul went for a run 
and Sam resisted being dragged out of bed), we drove most of the way 
across the Peak to Great Masson Cavern, near Matlock. This is a fine 
(dry!) cave/mine with an entrance in a disusued quarry, where some chaps
 were 'dry-tooling' up the cliff at the entrance (climbing with crampons
 and ice-axes - I didn't even know that was a thing).
</p><p>There was an entertaining round trip with some 'combined tactics'
 to get people up a small shaft, then a very interesting wander round 
the mine with kibbles, shafts, minerals, pipes and a very confusing 
cave. Miguel, Sam and Agnieszka went for a walk instead (one hangover - 2
 keen to see the outside of the Peak).
</p><p>T/U 3hrs

</p><p><b>Sunday</b>: In an unguarded moment at the pub a week or so 
before this trip, a Caver of Larger Circumference had let slip that he 
might be persuaded to try Daren Cilau. Being unable to think of a 
convincing excuse, he found himself walking up the hillside on Sunday 
morning with a jovial group of cavers who kept picking up (and being 
admonished to put down) pointy sticks, and soon was underground. He had 
secretly pinned his hopes on not fitting through The Vice. After a few 
minutes quiet contemplation followed by a few minutes of wriggling, 
however, he was horrified to find himself on the other side. There he 
was met by Another Caver, grinning from ear to ear in a manner that 
plainly said 'you've had it now, mate.' A slightly delayed pair of 
cavers caught up in the entrance crawl, and the combined group of six 
proceeded through the cave to exit at Price's Dig - an impressive piece 
of navigation by Another Caver. The Caver of Larger Circ. was knackered.

The first caving trip of the new academic year! Somehow we all managed 
to arrive in Derbyshire within 5 minutes of each other and in good time 
for a quick trip down Carlswark Cavern on Saturday afternoon. As 
everyone who has been to Carlswark knows, it is not much to write home 
about! However, it was a fun trip and served its purpose of working up a
 good appetite for fish and chips afterwards.
</p><p>On Sunday, we split into two groups with one going to Peak Cavern
 and the other to P8. I was in the P8 party so I can't comment on the 
Peak trip really, but it sounded like everyone enjoyed it. The P8 trip 
was excellent! Our early morning start paid off and we had the cave to 
ourselves. With heavy rain forecast for the afternoon, we decided not to
 do the loop at the bottom - just down to the sump and then back out the
 same way.
</p><p><b>Trip Report by Lisa Johnson-Davies</b>:
After our drive up to the Peak district we stopped next to a small hill 
and put on our caving gear, a surprisingly comfortable undersuit and an 
orange caving suit on top (which probably made us look like escapees 
from Guantanamo Bay to any passing locals). Our first trip was to a cave
 called Carlswark, and we were led to the hill and a tiny hole in the 
ground which I assumed was some kind of rabbit hole until we were told 
we had to go down the hole... Nial started rigging up a ladder, and then
 one by one we had to climb down the ladder into the dark depths of the 
bottomless pit below... 
</p><p>I managed to make it down the ladder in one piece, and then we 
continued down a very low-ceilinged passage; only with a combination of 
crawling, stooping and scrambling could we get through the passage. It 
was really hard work! I reckon this first cave was planned as a kind of 
test, and only the people that survived were able to progress onto the 
second cave the following day.&nbsp;:P (which was everyone luckily)
</p><p>After our hard work we went to get fish and chips, and then 
continued on to the caving hut, where we had drinks and chatted in the 
hut, and got told stories about the really exciting trips the club goes 
on, as well as caving trips gone wrong to reassure us for the trip the 
following morning.
The next day my group went to the cave P8, which has a stream that flows
 into the entrance and then continues throughout the entire cave. We had
 to climb down some rocks to get inside the cave which we discovered was
 the complete opposite of Carslwark, the cave from the day before. This 
cave had high ceilings but was quite narrow, and the stream meant all 
the rock faces were beautifully smooth and shiny. As an added bonus we 
got an educational geology lesson from resident geographer Nial about 
the formation of the rocks inside.&nbsp;:P This cave was really varied, 
and the obstacles involved climbing down a rope, doing tricky acrobatics
 on ladders (like climbing halfway  down one ladder and then jumping to 
another ladder, with a scary 5-10 metre drop below! At this point I 
should probably mention that you are secured in a harness for all the 
dangerous parts), traversing which essentially involved straddling 
across rocks to avoid walking through the river, and climbing down holes
 by bracing yourself against the walls. We weren't able to get to the 
very end of the cave because that would have involved cave diving with 
scuba diving equipment and a lot more experience than us novices had!
</p><p>The trip was a really enjoyable experience, and I definitely 
recommend caving to anyone interested in trying something a little 
different, and physically exhausting! The caving club are also very 
friendly, and if you are feeling a little nervous they can always be 
counted on to reassure you by telling you some caving horror 
stories.&nbsp;:)

</p><p>Saturday: Ogof Draenen. All up for breakfast at 7:30am so we 
could make it to the Lamb and Fox just in time to piggyback on a digging
 trip. We were late. Fortunately, we appeased them by contributing Emma 
to the dig effort (actually, she just didn't say no quickly or 
convincingly enough). The rest of us were underground by 10am (surely 
some mistake? Ed), and dispatched the entrance series fairly 
efficiently, owing to gravity assist for the larger caver. We were soon 
signing in at Cairn Junction. After a side trip to Straw Grotto, and a 
stop for Edvin to test some rusted-to-crap in-situ gear, we made for 
Gilwern Passage via Wonderbra Bypass. Much tedious boulder hopping was 
amply rewarded by some spectacular formations. At the end of the 
passage, the more dimensionally blessed elements of the team went on to 
explore north of a bouldery squeeze. Regrouping, we walked, teetered, 
clambered and cracked our shins back south along Gilwern Passage and on 
for a look at the streamway before heading out. We bypassed the bypass, 
securing opprobrium for the navigator. The entrance series seemed much 
wetter and colder on the way out! T/U 6.5hrs.
</p><p>Sunday: A few determined and hardy cavers (Jess, Emma, Sam) 
ambled into Daren Cilau while the rest of us went for a stroll and lazed
 about the hut.

</p><p>Saturday: Two groups for round trips in OFD I. Despite setting 
off on different routes, the parties ran into each other much more often
 than one might expect. Fun at Roundabout Chamber, some impressive 
formations and fine wet streamway made for an interesting and varied 
trip. Evening entertainment included a Saucepan and Sling friendly 
against UBSS.
</p><p>Sunday: A combined group visited Llygad Llwchwr on the western 
edge of the Black Mountain, half an hour's drive from the hut. Wriggling
 into a little hole above the stream resurgence gets you into a compact 
and interesting cave where high-level passageway meets the streamway in a
 series of impressive chambers.

</p><p>The presence of at least 200 cars in the layby near P8 indicated 
possible congestion in that cave. Fortunately, Edvin had the foresight 
to have obtained the access code for Bagshawe Cavern, near Bradwell. 
This is a curious cave, having been a lead mine c.1750, and later run as
 a show cave. Entering via a stone hut, and descending concrete steps in
 a mined out rift (don't spend too much time looking up - you'll just 
worry) brings you into natural cave. We split into a few small groups 
and explored. Entertainment on offer included a fine muddy slither 
leading down toward the terminal sump, an intimidating low crawl and a

<p>Cavers: Matt Watson and Alex Crow
</p><p>First we were going to S. Wales, then at the last minute Alex was
 sent to Hastings with work, so we opted for driving to Mendip on the 
Saturday morning (the definition of morning might have been pushing it 
by the time we actually left Cambridge!)
</p><p>We arrived at Priddy green just as most of the other cavers were 
coming out of Swildon's and heading to the Hunter's, and after an bit of
 faff trying to find someone who would answer their phone to leave a 
call out, we were off.
</p><p>We did the short round with a couple of detours to visit the 
Shatter series and Swildon's 4 streamway (this is a fine bit of passage 
and definitely worth a visit, though the section by cowsh' avens does 
smell a bit like following Toby through a small passage after he's had 
night on the beers and a dodgy curry) via blue Pencil passage.
</p><p>All in all this is a good trip, but hauling the extra tackle sack
 round the whole thing is a bit tedious. Especially when it tips it down
 the whole time you're underground and the streamway is a bit on the 
sporting side on the way out.
</p><p>We finally managed to book some accommodation while en route to 
the Hunter's, where we bumped into some CHECC people and were invited 
for a picnic down Hunter's Hole on Sunday, but sadly we didn't have our 
SRT gear.
</p><p>On Sunday we decided to have a fairly slack day and get back to 
Cambridge early. We headed over to Burrington and had a pootle round 
Pierre's pot, Sidcot swallet and Goatchurgh, before having cake in the 
cafe (highly recommended)and driving back.

Guest appearances by: Clive Westlake (Saturday), Frank Tully, John and Rachael Kendall
</p><p>Saturday 25th: Myself, David, John and Rachael were joined by 
Clive for a trip down to Sump one in Swildon's while Mark persuaded 
Frank for a rather more energetic trip: short round with detour to sump 
4.
</p><p>Sadly, our trip was cut short at the 20' (a pitch fabled to be 
20' that clearly isn't) where we met up with two scout groups. After 
waiting for half an hour, the situation clearly hadn't improved so we 
decided to can it and come out the wet way. We met up with Mark and 
Frank on the way in who asked if any of us wanted to join them, but We'd
 done enough queuing for today so headed back to the hut. Myself and 
David were still keen to spend a bit more time underground, so we headed
 over to Eastwater, for a bimble around the upper series (as we couldn't
 be bothered to take rope and ladders).
</p><p>In the evening we were treated to a slideshow by Clive and then headed over to the Hunter's
</p><p>Sunday 26th: For once CUCC made an early start and after minimal 
faff we headed over to G.B. Once again, Frank had been persuaded that 
the wiring he was supposed to be doing at home could wait for another 
weekend, and so we were joined by him and Mark. We did a quick trip down
 mud passage and the gorge, then came back out along the gallery, over 
the bridge and back up mud passage.
</p><p>A good weekend, though it would have been nice to have a few more cavers along from Cambridge.

<p>We had a caving fail, due to the weather, so went for a curry instead.
</p><p><b>Curryers</b>: Stuart Bennett, Tom Handford, Tess Jones, Mark Shinwell, Tony Rooke, Djuke Veldhuis, Matt Watson and Aiora Zabala 
</p><p>Few beers in Live and Let Live and headed over to the Koh-i-Noor.
 Though much less glamorous than its namesake in the Tower of London, 
they do a decent curry at a reasonable price and have the added 
advantage of a fairly "relaxed" booking system, so it's not a disaster 
if you turn up with twice or half as many people as you told them.

Saturday 28th:
Team keen consisted of Wookey, Jess, Tom and guest appearance by Olaf. 
They decided to go practice their cave flying skills in OFDIII and came 
back looking very tired.
</p><p>The second party consisted of Matt, Aiora and the newbies 
(Danial, Siobhan and Jan), who opted for a more civilised bimble round 
OFDII.
</p><p><br>
Sunday 29th:
Nobody was feeling ultra keen today, so we all went into Cwm Dwr down to
 the stream way - we split into two groups, one went via the wet way and
 the other via the dry way. Guest appearances by Olaf (who 
unsurprisingly didn't like the streamway) and Gareth.
</p><p>Events of Note: Tess came caving!

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="OFD_III_to_Smith.27s_Armoury_.282012.01.28.29_.28Wookey.29">OFD III to Smith's Armoury (2012.01.28) (Wookey)</span></h4>
<p>Wookey was on his first caving trip since expo, a mere 6 months ago, 
whilst Tom was on his first trip since October 2008. (he's been skulking
 in Cambridge all that time but apparently avoiding potholes&nbsp;:-).
</p><p>We wanted/needed some proper exercise and the weather was good 
(too nice to go caving really), so we headed across the traverses in 
OFDIII to Smith's Armoury right at the top end of the streamway. Not 
quite hard enough for the full 'welsh trips don't need ropes' approach 
we took a 'welsh SRT' approach with a 40m rope and another shorter 
piece, but no ladders and one foot-jammer each. 
</p><p>This is a very fine trip, although don't come if your shinning 
and 'ignoring big drops' skills aren't up to scratch as it has a great 
deal of shinning up and down and the famous traverses over rather large 
drops. It is possible to do the whole trip with no gear (Wookey was 
taken there this way sometime in the early 90's but even he thought it 
was a bit 'keen'). The 9m pitch/climb at the end of the crevasse really 
does need a handline+jammer at least. And a sensible level of gear is:
40m rope for the crevasse (5m down, traverse over big hole, 9m pitch). 
It would be a great deal easier if you brought a 30ft ladder for the 9m 
pitch, but we all managed with 1 jammer+footloop. There is also one 4m 
climb further on (before the traverses) which is sufficiently tricky 
that a rope is very sensible. A handy boulder at the top means you can 
pull it through afterwards if you bring a 12m bit of rope, otherwise you
 need a competent victim to downclimb it.
</p><p>We spent a good long time peering at the surveys to find the 
route and drew a very useful copy of the survey for the part from the 
Wedding cake to Bowhani junction, which is where most of the horizontal 
navigation is. The Wikipedia entry for the route from the crevasse to 
the streamway is really useful - we might not have made it without this 
as which level to be at is not totally obvious in places.
</p><p>The shortest route is via Timo's table, but as we wanted to a) go
 a way we knew at least the start of and b) show the others the way we 
went via Salubrious streamway.
</p><p>The two teams for the day joined up as far as the Salubrios 
junction so that Matt could remind himself what he was looking for on 
the way back. This caused a not-very-early start as everyone got sorted,
 lights were tied to helmets etc.
</p><p>We got underground at 12:30.
</p><p>So the route is in ODFII, through the brickyard, past the wedding
 cake, down the corkscrew climb to Salubrious then up Salubriuos through
 a lot of passage that doesn't really look much like the survey (we 
tried to turn right too early and were generally confused for a while), 
before finally popping out after a short crawly bit into Chasm passage. 
It's a lower-level of Chasm at this point, so remember to look out for 
it on the return. 
</p><p>Go left along the very high Chasm for a short distance, then 
right into Poached Egg passage, crossing a junction to get to Bowhani 
junction where 5 passages meet. We took a worthwhile detour for 20m or 
so to the left to look at 'Straw Gallery' which is indeed very nice. 
Turns out you can't go round the loop back to the passage due to a big 
drop, so go back the way you came.
</p><p>Going down to the right at Bowhani the general up-and-downiness 
commences, with a tricky climb and some traversing over holes. There is 
one more right turn to remember otherwise you'll go all the way up Creek
 Alley, and you have reached the crevase.
</p><p>This is an easy climb down made disconcerting by the 20m drop you
 could fall down, then you traverse over the hole and some false floor 
boulders to a 9m pitch. You can actually freeclimb this but it's really 
not very sensible, especially on the way back up as it's a slot you can 
fall out of into the big space, and it's very shiny and awkward. There 
are nice new stainless hangers+maillons on the crevasse climb+traverse 
and hangers on the pitch. We used a 42m rope which was plenty. This was 
handy in fact as when Wookey threw the tacklesack down (after being 
reassured that that was fine) it bounced off down the next drop to the 
bottom of the crevasse. Fortunately it was shinnable with a rope so was 
retreived without too much difficulty.
</p><p>We continued over more climbs in very up/down passage to get to a
 big space with a small boulder hole in the bottom corner. The easiest 
way is between the rocks but we did a tricky climb over the top instead.
 Down the bottom here seemed to be a dead end at moonmilky flowstone. We
 had to resort to the instructions as it didn't look traversable or 
shinnable. It is in fact a tricky 4m climb out of the bottom of the 
hole. This is the other place you would much prefer a rope (mostly for 
the return).
</p><p>Shortly after this the traverses proper are reached. The first 
move is most entertaining as you have to use a ledge on the left wall 
and teeter over, but it does have some very handy stal fingerholds which
 actually make it quite easy. Just don't think about the huge drop. 
There are no bolts anyway (that we saw) so a rope won't help. More 
traversing follows, with an unhelpfully wide bit at the end. Wookey did 
all of it about 6 times back and forth, showing the best route, and 
everyone made it. 
</p><p>The dead-straight passage ends at a hole in the floor. down 
there, then back under the floor to climb down an awkward canyon then 
back again to a upwards squeeze which would keep the fatties out. You 
can just feel (more than hear) the rumble of the streamway by now.
</p><p>Not too long after comes the bit in the photo with the really 
scary-looking ledge of calcited crap. This is in fact dead easy as you 
just step across the corner using a handy stal handhold. You have also 
become largely inured to big drops and delicate moves by now. There are 
some notable pretties along the way.
All that caving and climbing has been an effective numpty-filter so 
things are not trashed.
</p><p>Next is the comedy maypole bridge (long scaf-bar over big hole 
with the streamway below, which is also easier than it looks. God knows 
who carried that 15ft bar all the way down here! Well done to you sir.
</p><p>Despite having arrived at the streamway (it's just below through 
holes) you keep going along this passage in a rather confusing fashion 
until you really do come out at the streamway without climbing.
</p><p>Jess had been desperate for a piss for hours now, so enormous relief took place.
</p><p>We plopped into the streamway and waded on up, accompanied by 
wails from Olaf, who _really_ doesn't like getting cold and wet. The 
stream is quite 'canal'y here mostly knee to thigh deep and very calm, 
but it was bloody freezing and my knees soon went numb. Turns out that 
Olaf the wailer has those knee-length wetsocks which are popular with 
welsh cavers, and was still moaning! The deepest water was just above 
MSBL but it's easy to trip over a rock or slide on smooth sandy rock and
 get wetter.
</p><p>We saw 4 white cave fish, the longest about 12cm. They have eyes, but don't appear to be able to see.
</p><p>The streamway is beatiful with marble streakings, sandbanks, and 
all sorts of forms. It's much quieter than down at I and II. It took 
about 40 mins to get to Smith's Armoury where we had a quick snack and 
buggered off out again. Wading for over an hour gives you thigh-ache.
</p><p>So then we wizzed back out, not getting lost at all and not 
hanging around too much. There was a certain amount of quiet 
concentration and ehightened pulserates from Tom on the way back over 
the traverses, and we all struggled up the crevasse pitch with our 
welsh-SRT single jammer. But overall an efficient return was made and we
 were out in 3 hours (it took nearly 5 to get in).
</p><p>Tess had been a star and cooked dinner for all by the time we got
 back, so a huge plate of pasta +veggie+oxfords leftovers was scoffed.
</p><p>A most excellent trip with a great deal of caving in it. It 
should be done more often than once every 20years. I was knackered 
though and had to go to bed by 11pm. 
</p><p>Oh, and Wookey and Tom had terrible body-ache the next day.
</p><p>T/U: 8 hours.

<p>Beautiful caving weekend in Bull Pot farm. County Pot - Lancs 
exchange on Saturday, where one of the parties did comb some parts of 
the route up to three times (to make sure that we learnt the way 
properly) and finished an epic roundtrip by going back to Lancs from 
County aboveground to derig the entrance. The team lose one of their 
exhausted members after six hours caving which had accidentally brought 
the team back very close to the entrance.
</p><p>Short through trip in Heron Pot on Sunday, all the way down a 
pretty meander with a couple of wet pitches in between, where photos 
were taken. For the finishing touch, a fully soaking crawl right at the 
very end of the meander. Unfortunately we didn't arrive on time for a 
well deserved tasty cake &amp; tea at Ingleton.

through the CNCC rigging guide, we managed to find some maillons, a few 
crabs and some ropes that were almost but not entirely the wrong length 
for any of the caving we were planning to do.
</p><p>Cue some last minute transport-rearrangement faff and we were 
finally off to Yorkshire only an hour and a half behind schedule. 
Several hours, and a portion of fish and chips later, we arrived at the 
farm to find Edvin, Kathryn, Martin and a rather large pile of empties 
huddled up in front of the fire. Not wanting to be antisocial, we 
decided to add a few to the pile and come up with a plan for Saturday’s 
caving. For the first time I can remember, we came up with a plan that 
actually involved the caves we had permits for: County-Lancs exchange.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Saturday_29th_October:_Lost_in_Lancs_.28by_Matt.29">Saturday 29th October: Lost in Lancs (by Matt)</span></h4>
<p>Next morning we were up bright and early. Due to an error in the 
decimal place when calculating how many people do the shopping for, we 
had enough food to provide everyone at the farm with at least two 
breakfasts, and still have leftovers for the next day! Replete, we then 
split up into our respective teams: Team efficient and team 
keen-but-incompetent, and set off across the fell.
</p><p>Team keen-but-incompetent were set to go down Lancs. Being quite a
 few meters shy of the suggested rope length, Martin took frugal rigging
 to a new level, and after rigging two rebelays that were tighter than a
 ducks arse, arrived at the bottom of the pitch with the rope bag still 
half full. So far so good. The plan was to go down to the the streamway 
via a loop round Montague West and Wilf Taylor's passage, climb up into 
the high level route at Stop Pot and then make our way over to County. 
That was the keen bit, now for the incompetent part. . .
</p><p>Rather than a blow-by-blow account of our navigational 
incompetence, which would be quite challenging given the number of 
unintentional detours, let's just say that nine hours after leaving the 
surface myself and Martin emerged into the mist and drizzle at county 
pot having successfully completed the traverse. This was quite a feat, 
given six hours into the trip we met team efficient 15 minutes from the 
Lancaster Hole entrance. . .
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Heron_Pot.2C_Kingsdale._30th_Oct_2011._By_Adrian">Heron Pot, Kingsdale. 30th Oct 2011. By Adrian</span></h4>
<p>An early start at Bullpot Farm and perfect coordination brought us to
 Kingsdale at around 2pm (+/- 1hr). We changed and kitted up at the 
roadside and headed off across the valley floor with a few members of 
the party holding 'phones at arms length and pausing to squint at them 
from time to time. We continued over the beck and up the hillside in 
this manner, then fanned out along the ridge. Shouts of 'I've got it!' 
would be followed seconds later by 'damn! It's gone.' We had, of course,
 managed not to leave a call out.
</p><p>We had a peep in the exit and decided it would go, then 'got 
it...damn, it's goned' our way to the entrance. Fortune smiled on us and
 we got a message through to the Fenland Control Centre. After a few 
minutes discussion with our director of photography, Olly descended the 
entrance. 'Do I get a sherpa, then?' he called up. With a sigh I grabbed
 the rope bag and followed. The first few metres are best approached by 
crawling in the bottom of the rift. Olly dragged the bag and I helped it
 past constrictions. Soon we were walking in fine meandering passage.
</p><p>I sensed a presence behind me. Looking over my shoulder I saw 
Matt's lamp approaching, carried, I assumed, by Matt. 'They've found us!
 Hurry!' I shouted to Olly, who then sprinted off down the passage. I 
followed at best speed, wishing I was thinner (more running, fewer 
pies). I arrived panting at the pitch head to find it already rigged, 
and our fearless rigger standing around the corner ready to descend. The
 others caught up and we had a debate about who would carry flashguns 
and where they would put them (I should have fled at this point, but I 
did not).
</p><p>'Pitch free!' I made a minor spectacle of myself by getting my 
leg stuck as I part climbed, part thrutched on to the pitch head. I 
touched down on a short, rather wet horizontal section before the next 
pitch. Olly went off to rig the next pitch and Aiora was soon on her way
 down the first - rather more elegantly than your narrator.
</p><p>Now the Director of Photography was in charge. Yves got on the 
rope, abseiled a few metres down the pitch and tied off his stop. Matt 
was stationed above the pitch head with a flashgun. I heard someone 
above bellow 'Cow! karabiner! waterfall! spanner!' I might be mistaken 
about that - the water was making a lot of noise. Eventually, through 
shouting, gestures and arcane lamp signals, I was positioned in the 
plunge pool, more or less under the waterfall, pointing a flashgun up 
the pitch.  Here I remained for 20 minutes while the DoP composed the 
perfect shot. My good cheer deteriorated. I might have uttered an oath. 
Presently, the job was done. Yves unlocked his stop and descended to the
 bottom, complaining cheerfully about his numb legs.
</p><p>Olly and Aiora had gotten restless and gone off exploring during 
my refreshing 20min frigid shower. They retured and Matt joined us at 
the bottom of the pitch. The DoP set about the business of re-rigging 
the pitch as a pull through. Descending the pitch, he asked Olly to hold
 the rope clear of the waterfall. Olly obliged and was rewarded by being
 yanked into the plunge pool. He kept his footing and avoided a soaking 
(or, at any rate, postponed it).
</p><p>Soon we were on the move. The passage toward the exit is nicely 
sculpted, good splashy fun. There are a few flowstone formations to 
stoop under. After a while, it closes down to a longish, wet 
hands-and-knees crawl. Mostly this is on smooth rock, but occasionally 
on cobbles. Trying to keep a dry-bag full of flashguns out of the water 
made this much harder work than it might otherwise have been, and the 
others disappeared into the distance. Eventually I reached the exit 
duck. I fiddled with my SRT kit a bit, ostensibly to avoid getting 
snagged in the duck, but really to play for time. I gritted my teeth, 
laid down in the murky stream and pushed myself into the constricted 
passage, emitting a strangled squeak as I got a gallon of freezing water
 down the front of my oversuit. I pushed the flashgun bag ahead of me to
 the DoP and squeezed out of the exit. The outside world was dark and 
the evening air mild. We walked back to the cars, sometimes chatting, 
sometimes in companionable silence.
</p><p>We changed again at the roadside. I was advised to be circumspect
 when admitting to 'spannering Matt's maillon.' Mark showed me a preview
 of the pictures of Yves on the second pitch - they looked good, 
promising to be well worth a few minutes freezing.  Soon we were in 
Ingleton, just too late for tea and cake at [insert name of your 
favourite gear shop/cafe here]. Doughnuts and drinks from the co-op 
sufficed and after chatting for a while we got in the cars and 
dispersed.
</p><p>A thoroughly enjoyable Sunday afternoon trip.

<p>The first meet of 2007 will be a one day introductory trip to the 
Mendips. Leaving on Saturday afternoon, we will go caving in Swildon's 
Hole on Sunday and return to Cambridge on Sunday evening. Swildon's is 
an excellent introductory cave, as its extensive passages provide 
opportunities for more or less challenging trips.
</p><p>Total cost for the trip will be £25, but you will need to bring extra money for food on Saturday and Sunday nights (see the <a href="http://caving.soc.srcf.net/wiki/Costs" title="Costs">Costs</a> page for more details).
</p><p>Swildon's Hole involves one short ladder descent, so there will 
be a training session on the Saturday afternoon before we leave 
Cambridge. It is advisable to attend, but not compulsory if you can't 
make it.
</p><p>If you went on the trip, some photos are available here:

<p>The second meet of this term will be a week-end trip to South Wales. 
Leaving on Friday afternoon, we will go caving in Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (OFD)
 on Saturday, have a delicious meal in the hut on Saturday night, go 
caving or hiking on Sunday and return to Cambridge on Sunday evening.

</p><p>OFD is  is an excellent introductory cave, it is the deepest cave in the UK and the second longest in Wales. 
</p><p>For a novice renting a basic gear set the cost for the trip will 
be £29.50, but you will need to bring extra money for food on Friday and
 Sunday nights (see the <b><a href="http://caving.soc.srcf.net/wiki/Costs" title="Costs">Costs</a></b>
 page for more details), and for eventual beer. This trip in particular 
will not require any vertical gear but please make an effort to come to 
the <b><a href="http://caving.soc.srcf.net/wiki/Training" title="Training">training</a></b> on Tuesdays as we will do more ladder training and perhaps SRT training.

Our annual New Year's trip to Yorkshire. It isn't mandatory to come for 
the full week. And it's a good way to get in some out of term caving!
The plan above is just a list of the permits we got so far but there are
 plenty of non permit caves in Yorkshire and endless possibilities of 
caving&nbsp;:)
