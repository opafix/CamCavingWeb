  <h1>Aven Gregoire</h1>

  <h2>How to get there</h2>
  <p>Park in Tharaux, the closest parking place is part way up the village, you are not allowed to drive through the village. From the car park walk through the village down the steps to rejoin the road, follow the road up and underneath an arch. By the final house of the village is a well hidden path going down on the left, this is the route to the river entrance. For the top entrance follow the road as it turns into a gravel track then back into tarmac as it rounds a corner. at the corner is a path leading off the right. Follow this path as it leads up the hill to a large entrance shaft. </p>

  <h2>Equipment</h2>
  <p>Rope for exhange. 100m gets down to the top of the tobogan 30m to the top of the slope 45m down to the traverse followed by the stemple climb A rope (15m) is advised for the stemple climb, in 2018 there was an insitu rope Follow the passage to a traverse over a hole, a sling is required for a natural, 20m There are a multitude of passages from here, look for a downward climb with an arrow and insitu tat. The correct way quickly reaches P hangers followed by a pull through anchor. The tobogan can be broken up with 2 spits. 70m Wonder along the big passage until a sump is reached, backtrack ~5m to find more stemples on the left wall (15m) Wall passage leads to a tricky climb, this is not the way on, back track 10m and climb up on the right (when approaching from the stemples) A crawl is reached by traversing around some holes. The crawl contains an easy climb down into a drafting passage which soon reaches two short pitches (30m should cover both) Some more walking passage leads to the next pitch (15m) The final pitch reaches the lake, (20m) The lake is best crossed with a boat. In 2018 the traverse around the lake was rigged with tat. Before exiting the cave take a look at the opening into the river, viewed from the right angle the caves looks like s skull. To exit walk up the slope into the higher level cave and find the path which skirts around the cliff and up into the village. </p>
  <p>Take 45 krabs, 6 slings, 4 hangers </p>
  <p>As a pull through take 2 70m rope </p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A fine cave. Climb down to a large ledge with two P hangers for the first Y hang, rebelay off the tree and descend. The way on is a small blowing passage on the far side, not down the massive slope, follow the hangers. If rigging for an exchange a spit provides a deviation. </p>
